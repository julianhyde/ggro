<h3>Help For the GGRO Data Entry / Admin Program</h3>
 
<h4>What are the admin functions?&nbsp;</h4>
<b>SetDate - </b>Use this to change the date. Note that it won't stop you
from entering a date that isn't in the database.<br>
<br>
<b>Set Database - </b>Toggle between the Entry database and the Permanent
Database. You can edit the data in either. <br>
<br>
<b>Commit to Main - </b>Copy the entire contents of the entry database into
the permanent database. The entry database will be emptied in the process.
The intent is to clean the data in the entry database, as needed, and commit
to the main database. <br>
<br>
<h4><br>
</h4>
<h4>How do I enter the data?</h4>
 --The program is designed to look pretty much like the field form. Copy
the non-zero values for each species for each hour into the place where they 
appear in the program. It will calculate the totals automatically. You can 
use the mouse, enter key, tabs, etc, as you like.&nbsp;  
<h4>What should I enter on the Dark Morph tab? This doesn't look like the 
field form.</h4>
 --Enter the species under the appropriate hour column. (There are no totals 
for dark morphs). <br>
 
<h4>Where do I enter the date?</h4>
 --The date is set automatically to "today".   
<h4>How do I save the data?</h4>
 --Select "Save Data" from the File menu. <br>
 
<h4>How do I exit the program? </h4>
 --Select "Exit" from the File menu. <br>
 
<h4>I closed the program but noticed that I forgot to enter some data. Now 
what do I do? </h4>
 --Simply start the program again, and finish entering the data. <br>
 
<h4>When I re-opened the program, there are a bunch of zeroes that I didn't 
enter. Should I be worried?&nbsp;</h4>
 --No. 
<h4>I saved the data, but I made a mistake. &nbsp;Can I just change it and 
save it again?</h4>
 --Yes. 
<h4>The Save Data menu item is not enabled, so I can't save the data!</h4>
 --Either no data has been entered, or you already saved it. If you think 
you haven't saved the data and now can't for some reason, do the following: 
Enter a zero somewhere it won't make any difference (perhaps "Goshawk" has 
a zero column today); hit &nbsp;the Enter key. Now "Save Data" should be enabled.
