<p>Friday's Nov 20, 2020 hawk count team enjoyed a remark-able final day of the season, with brisk (50s-60 deg.) east winds in the AM, and a handful of accipiter sightings in the first few hours. We got some great Peregrine looks as well, adults and juvs, and a steady stream of Redtails and Harriers throughout the day, including three juv harriers in a column over Slacker Hill. The eagle sightings were all distant -- along the Wolf Ridge skyline - but gave the day a snap of excitement.<br/><br/>One of the highlights of the day was estimating flock sizes on Band-tailed Pigeons, which were especially active in the morning hours.  Several flocks were over 200 individuals and appeared to span a quarter-mile across the sky. The flocks below eye-level catching the AM sun against the backdrop of rock, coyote brush, and various colors of grasslands, are like so many uniform pieces of lapis tracking across the landscape. Hard not to be impressed. Our day total was a conservative 2000+ BTPI sightings.<br/><br/>GGRO's Covid-Safe Hawkwatch 2020 finished up the autumn migration season today. Final species tallies will be forthcoming, but our count hours are close to 160 for the last three months.  This is about one-third of a "normal" count season for us, and we are all grateful that we could pull together such a meaningful dataset for this strange year. <br/><br/>Our great thanks to our 15 scheduled covid-safe hawk counters: Christine Carino, James McDermott, Linda Schneider, Robert Blumberg, Sam Hontalas, Dan Foldes, Erica Harris, Mary Kenney, Jane Rudebusch, George Eade, Bob Power, Cheryl Lentini, Deborah Crooks, Michaela Figari, and Nancy Elliot.  We are also grateful to the many non-schueduled banders and hawkwatchers who took time to come up to the Hill and watch outside the gates. You all were critical contributors to a spirit of migration constancy and excellent data collection.<br/><br/>Also thanks to our NPS and Parks Conservancy supervisors and colleagues who guided us through a shifting 2020 planning process, advocating for us all along the way: Bill Merkle, Alison Forrestel, Natasha Arnold, Ronni Johnson, Sharon Farrell, Sue Gardner, Denise McKinney, and - especially - Janet Klein. The eagle's share of the planning, strategizing, coordination, and success of the 2020 GGRO hawk count was by Step Wilson.<br/><br/>Many more people contributed skill and expertise also and will be listed in a 2020 end of the season report.  But for now deep thanks to you all. On behalf of the GGRO staff - Step Wilson, Teresa Ely, Kelsie McInnis - good winter birds to you, and thanks for following the great work of the GGRO. - Allen Fish<br/><br/>PS - If you'd like to be on the mailing list for our free quarterly email newsletter, the GGRO Quarterly - please send an email to ggro@parksconservancy.org -<br/>

<p>While it was foggy just about everywhere else in the Bay Area, Hawk Hill was miraculously clear when the Thursday team arrived, making for another full if slow day. Conditions seemed optimal for some large raptor sightings, but it was not to be. Instead we were dealt a sparse flight of tails, harriers and tvs, with a sprinkling of falcons and accipiters for good measure. A COVID-safe donut delivery sweetened a bittersweet last Thursday of the season. -DC of Thursday Team C<br/>

<p>Though stormy skies had passed, a thick blanket of fog persisted as the Tues/Wed team assembled for their final time together on the hill this season. In the company of the king and queen raven pair and their loyal song sparrow subjects, we celebrated a successful season counting amid challenges of pandemic-level proportion. Come fire and smoke, seemingly unending summer heat, high wind and rain, power outages and porta-potty woes, our dedicated team of six faithfully counted migrating raptors, passerines, and insects. We delighted in our collective spirit for the task at hand, and were able to seamlessly apply our prior training and knowledge to identifying and passing birds to each other like pros. Some of us met each other for the first time in September, yet it felt like we had been a family for years and years. We owe this to the hard work of the GGRO in diligently building the good foundation of a hawkwatcher from day 1, so that when we came together this fall we could get right down to business and all knew exactly how to make this machine run smoothly. Now that the 2020 season has closed, we will look back and the challenges and triumphs. At the bald eagles and ferrugs, and sharpies and coops, and harriers and kites, and peregrines and merlins, and so many more amazing sightings we had. We will still reach for the elusive pizza bird (rough-legged hawk) that we missed as it detoured through Duluth instead. We will enjoy the sweet treats we shared today and hold the memories of our time together close. As we drive about our lives, we will hang our heads out the window to wonder "is that red-shouldered hawk on the telephone pole or just a really big coop" In our dreams, our premonitions of seeing California condors at Hawk Hill will be fulfilled and we will be dunking them into the Dunkadoo by the hundreds. And, we will count down the days until next fall when we can hawkwatch again. <br/>

<p>We never reached the 300 and 500 plus raptors that had been seen a few years earlier in the first weeks of November by one team member, but 2 adult Bald Eagles traveling together first thing were inspiring. But we scanned diligently and counted nearly 1000 Band-tailed Pigeons and another 105 raptors. Our day was complete and fulfilling.<br/>

<p>OK, we know that there was a storm coming in today, but we were greedy. Our fellow counters tallied 8 Bald Eagles Mon-Thurs this week, so surely there's going to be a Bald around today. No. Nope. Not even.  We had to settle for 6 Peregrine sightings, long sweeping and corkscrewing flights in the pre-storm winds, tail-chasing Redtails, Ravens and Harriers. Peregrines never learned the word shy.<br/><br/>The winds never calmed today, gusting from 15 to 20 mph, and steady around 7-8 mph from the South.  Temps also pretty constant - low 50s most of the day with wind chill to the mid 40s. Our intrepid team lasted until a late day and late season Osprey flew across the western sky heading south, and reminding us that the wall of rain was about to hit. We closed up at 1 pm.<br/><br/>Since much of the bird action on Hawk Hill in November is White-crowned Sparrows below and Turkey Vultures above, Richard Wilbur's poem fragment seems apt today:<br/><br/>"Still, citizen sparrow, this vulture which you call unnatural, let him but lumber again to air over the rotten office, let him bear the carrion ballast up, and at the tall tips of the sky lie cruising."<br/>

<p>If you aren't editing your accipiters you ain't hawkwatchin'. <br/><br/>After a few days of low sharp-shinned hawks numbers, we were excited to count a few every hour throughout the day. We had a few moments of "Is this a Sharp-shinned or a Cooper's hawk" and they usually ended up being sharpies, but we did see a couple coops. We were very certain about the three different bald eagles that came pretty close to the hill.  Lots of northern harriers were seen today too. We felt hints of a storm coming, but it was also warm during some hours and found ourselves putting on and taking off jackets as we rotated quadrants. We watched a male Kestrel catch a sparrow in a bush along the trail, and flew towards us basically showing off its prey. We also found that real time data checks are helpful.

<p>White throated swifts raining out of the sky like confetti, late-season sharpies zooming past, a front row seat to the peregrine show at 11:00. FIVE. BALD. EAGLES. Four seen during prime time--including an adult pair circling over Wolfback Ridge together--plus a fifth seen before the start of the count by early bird, eagle-eyed hawkwatcher, George. Dozens of porpoising harbor porpoise, a lone male kestrel, an adult male harrier and several juvs, a vortex of hundreds of swirling brown pelicans, and an afternoon flurry of red-tails of all flavors: adults and juvs, light, intermediate, and dark morphs. All framed in beautiful Autumn light with visibility for miles, it was not a bad way to close our penultimate week of the hawk count.<br/>

<p>Beautifully clear cool day. Very distant sighting of Short-eared Owl past volcano and two hours later beyond step house. Wished it was closer and the distant Golden Eagle at Hill 88. Luckily the bald came close from the south even though it didn't stay long. Thanks Keith, George, and Carol at the wingspans.<br/>

<p>Friday's count started at 10 am with a steady NW wind of 7 to 10 mph, gusting to 25, and never changed. Clouds built throughout the day, finally building up some cumulus streets in the afternoon that created spectacular cloud shadows and generally crystalline light.<br/><br/>A quiet hawk day - we were lucky to get any accipiters at all.  The winds never relented and we are between low pressure systems.<br/><br/>Other highlights included:<br/><br/>(1) Watching two CHP motorcycle police ride down the Coastal Trail, and then a few dozen mins later, arrive at the top of Hawk Hill. They parked on the middle platform and greeted us covid-safely from the fenceline, and were delighted by the whole raptor migration thing.<br/><br/>(2) Observing three Ravens spend an hour in the high wind part of the day and the sky "stick-surf" where they: ride a stick through the air, moving it from feet to beak and back again; share one stick so that two Ravens ride side by side; drop the stick from high and try to catch it before it hits the ground; do somersaults with the stick rotating over the top of the bird.  This kept us going from 1 pm to 2 pm.<br/><br/>(3) Raptor-wise the most interesting part of the day was watching what shape changes are possible as a hawk is trying to not be blown off-course.  How streamlined can a Cooper's Hawk become to keep from getting blown to San Jose? One of ours seemed to be flying purely on alulas today.  (Alula = thumb feather.)<br/><br/>(4) Brown Pelicans everywhere today - in big flocks, 10 to 30 mostly inside the Golden Gate, some 1000s of feet in the air. Presumably moving around between storms, on the big big winds.<br/><br/>(4) A full rainbow landing its right footing on the North tower of the GG Bridge at 330 pm - a lovely bit of eye-candy for the long windy day.<br/><br/>

<p>The Thursday team was greeted by an unseasonal, clear, warm day that began with a light breeze from the east and ended with winds from the west. A number of Northern Harriers moved through early in the day, and we were pleased to see the Merlins were acting like Merlin's again. <br/><br/>Despite the west wind picking up as the afternoon progressed, the raptors did not. Instead, we continued to count many Band-tailed Pigeons in the headlands, and a few Fox Sparrows, as well as the Ravens, which all kept our attention off the news.<br/><br/>In lieu of aging birds, we aged ourselves, finding common ground in birds as well as the occasional song lyric -- ("movin on over," "penguins are so sensitive" and "making [its] way back to you [Bob]") and attempts at poetry:<br/>The tail comes on the north wind/red feathers flashing in the fall sun.

<p>Feelings of trepidation from current events percolated over the hill today, but our spirits were lifted by clear views, great company, and some good bird sightings. Serenaded by a cacophony from bagpipes in the mid-morning and foghorns in the afternoon, we saw many sharpies, harriers, and kestrels. A juvenile peregrine and four merlins were a treat. One of these merlins was strikingly pale, belonging to the Prairie subspecies more commonly found in the interior western U.S. We also saw a juvenile ferruginous hawk lazily circling over the summit of Angel Island, before catching a direct line south over the city skyline. All fingers and toes are crossed that the incoming cold front arriving later this week brings in some exciting late-season tundra buteos, and other surprises from the north for all to enjoy.<br/>

<p>For the first time all season those extra layers toted in our packs came in handy, as afternoon winds shifted to the west and gusted up to 25 mph. A peregrine dueling a raven, close encounters with kestrels and merlins, and two appearances by a juvenile golden eagle were among many highlights. We also were treated by a leucistic red-tailed hawk in the a.m. showing off alternating white and brown primaries, secondaries, and tail feathers, like the keys on a piano. Today we celebrated the birthday of teammate Erica. A big happy birthday wish to you Erica from all of us on the hawk crew!!<br/>

<p>Friday morning showed Hawk and Slacker hills to be islands of bird migration magnificence, sitting 300 feet above the ocean of fog on all sides.  The fog retreated during the day with a light SW wind which became a steady 10 mph breeze from the west after noon. Temps never got out of the mid 60s and jackets were required in the final hours of the day.<br/><br/>Raptorwise we had a consistent gentle stream of Redtails and Vultures, a few Sharpshins, fewer Cooper's Hawks, four "blink or you miss them" Merlins, and other assorted characters.  LOTS of BT Pigeons, some flocks of Purple Finches, and a handful of Variegated Meadowhawks - perhaps the last dragonflies of the season.<br/><br/>Remember that we often see a peak flight of interesting color morph Redtails and other buteos during November, so Hawk Hill migration-watching has another month to roll out its mysteries. Come watch! Your psyche deserves to see birds of prey migrate across the skies above the Golden Gate.  Does a human good.<br/><br/><br/>

The importance of landmarks was highlighted by the adult Ferruginous Hawk, moving past the Porta Potty at hawk camp as it flew from view. While it wasn't a big-number day, it was nonetheless a good one for Northern Harriers and Red-shouldered hawks.-Thursday Team C<br/>

<p>The Oct 23 count started with low fog surrounding Hawk Hill and a light westerly breeze. Temps stayed in the 60s-70s all day as the fog pulled back to off shore.<br/><br/>A steady stream of Redtails and Turkey Vultures formed the backbone of the flight today, with a few Redshoulders and 2 late Broadwings among the buteos.  Some adults in with the accips, and two stunning Peregrine juvs -- one with deep bronzey dark background and muddy streaking throughout the underbody and underwings, and the other a pale-brown-backed bird with a very pale face and cap, presumed a tundrius.  Some great Merlin flybys today.<br/><br/>Maybe due to the cool weather or the actual turning of the seasons, not a dragonfly to be seen on Hawk Hill today, although several Vanessa butterflies were flapping around the hilltop. No swifts nor swallows, but some BT Pigeon flocks.<br/>

<p>The ten o'clock hour was met by zero visibility in any direction. The team had a very constructive book and movie suggestion discussion while waiting for clearing. <br/><br/>Suggestions to offer: "My Octopus Teacher", "Kiss the Ground", the Attenborough "A Life on Our Planet" docs. Novels "The Overstory", "Where the Crawdads Sing","Celine", "A Boy and His Dog at the End of the World", anything by Louise Erdrich. Non fiction books: "Underland", "The Hidden Life of Trees", "Sand Talk". <br/><br/>By 1 pm despite some teasing moments, a steady west breeze kept the fog coming in steadily, preventing any count. We did have some nice time conversing with the resident ravens.<br/><br/>

<p>We were greeted by massive fog bank on the Bay this morning, but clear blue skies at the top of the Hill. Within 30 minutes of starting, the fog overtook the Hill, causing us to suspend the count. By 11 am, the fog had sunken low again and we reconvened to continue tallying hawks. Glad we did! The flight was steady - many Redtails today. By late afternoon, the fog began to creep back up. We eventually lost most of west and north to the thick clouds of moisture but continued counting until our 3 pm stop time with decent visibility east and south. A Northern Harrier made a quick appearance 2 minutes before the count ended (our first/only NOHA of the day), bumping us up to 11 species - a fun sighting to end the count on!<br/>

<p>Oct 16 started warm, but the BIG east wind picked up immediately this AM and provided cool fans for our count team today. Unfortunately the temp rose slightly throughout the day and by 130 pm reached 90-degrees, our threshold for stopping the count. So we did.<br/><br/>Starting to see more of a continuous train of juv Redtails as to be expected, and the adult accipiters are splitting the sky with the juveniles.  (Almost all juv accipiters in September at Golden Gate. Take a look in your Sibley guide to see the differences between these two plumages.) We saw the last - maybe - Broad-winged Hawk heading to Latin America somewhere for the winter.<br/><br/>Highlights were an AM juvenile Ferruginous Hawk, the big grasslands buteo once called the "Rusty-chapped Squirrel-Hawk" - except the juv's chaps (leg feathers) are white or gray.  This beauty got tail-chased to the North by an aggressive Raven.  And a bit later, while counting a column of Redtails, we noted that the top hawk was not in fact a hawk, but a pale-buffy, floppy-winged Short-eared Owl.  The owl flopped westward then disappeared as fast as it had shown up.<br/><br/>Other stuff? A steady stream of VG Swallows, also Band-tailed Pigeons, moving by.  A noticeable lack of visiting hawkwatchers, but later we realized they were staying cool in the tunnels below HAwk Hill.  Smart as an owl.<br/>

<p>When we got up on the hill it was warm and windy. Adult sharp-shinned hawks finally made an appearance mid-morning and had an early Merlin fly of the bridge. <br/><br/>A male kestrel gave us a show - eating a lizard in the air near east and north quadrants. There was a run of adult sharpies which continued throughout the day. There were also a lot of red shoulders today and we had a lot of good looks. There were a lot of juvenile turkey vultures flying through the Headlands. <br/><br/>One humpback whale in the bay. Pipeline Swallow tails were abundant. <br/><br/>The Team remained focused like grim professionals. Adult red-tails and juvenile cooper's hawks define much of the afternoon. More adult sharp-shinned hawks, an osprey, and an harrier to round out the day. (This blog was written by the entire Thursday Team.)<br/>

<p>A Merlin greeted the Hawkwatchers with a slow pass across the top of the hill as we were setting up for the day. In the morning, there was a decent amount of activity from adult and juvenile sharpies and Cooper's hawks, red-tails, and northern harriers. We had several male kestrels and a few more merlins make an appearance. Highlights of mid-day were an adult ferruginous hawk that glided by the west quad and gave great looks of it's rusty red features. Soon after, a juvenile ferruginous hawk came by, a male harrier circled near Mt. Tam, and an adult bald eagle was spotted out in the north saddle. Unlike the BAEA from yesterday, this bird stayed far out in the north and did not give us close looks. <br/><br/>Shortly after noon, the heat was high and the wind was nonexistent, which no wind slowed the flight down to a near standstill. Only a squadron of turkey vultures passing around the headlands was there to entertain us. Mercifully, just before 2:00pm a strong breeze from the west picked up to revitalize both the hawks and the watchers. More sharp-shinned hawks came through, bringing the total above 60 for the day, and another merlin visited close by. We ended the day with a brief look at an adult peregrine falcon, and a very close view of an adult female harrier. Sadly, no broad-winged hawks were seen today, perhaps signaling a shift in the migration season.<br/><br/>

<p>Today started hot with a light eastern wind, as the day progressed the wind shifted from NNW and the cool breeze made the temps manageable. The hottest afternoon reading was 84-degrees.<br/><br/>Most of today's flight was Redtail and TV.  Some good numbers of Sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks especially after 12 noon.  Broadwings seen in small numbers throughout the day - 11 in all. <br/><br/>The day's highlight? An adult Bald Eagle that drifted from Hill 88 vicinity, cruised toward Hawk Hill, then climbed another 500 ft over Hawk Hill and lined out for parts south.<br/><br/>LOTS of non-rapts today - Band-tailed Pigeons and Violet-green Swallows by the 100s, but also hundreds of Variegated Meadowhawks, and some Common Green Darners and Black Saddlebags.<br/>

<p>Hawk Hill was slow to clear after a night of fog + mist + misty-rain? - perhaps.  There were puddles on the hilltop.  We started the count at 1045 with crystal clear light and beautiful clouds and an explosion of termites.  Yes, I said termites - little black ones - I'll try to get an ID but the were winged and swarming out of holes in the ground on the hard-gravel top of Hawk Hill. 100s per minute emerging and flying into the sky. And where there are termites....<br/><br/>White-throated Swifts provided the most active entertainment, taking the word ZOOM much more seriously than we do. Dozens in the sky at once often strafing, stooping, sweeping, barnstorming, and zooming between hawk counters, not even pretending to respect the 10 foot distances we have set for ourselves.<br/><br/>Beyond the swifts, we noted both a Western Fence Lizard and a Bewick's Wren going to town on termites. Also a half dozen Western Bluebirds. No insectivores are going hungry on Hawk Hill tonight.<br/><br/>Raptor highlights were a steady showing of Broad-winged Hawks, some close, some far, including a dark morph juvenile cruising south. This has been a quiet year for Peregrines, however a pair o'Peregrines - one adult, one juv - did a spectacular fandango around, across, and through the sky over Hawk Hill for several minutes, thrilling us all, except perhaps the juvenile Redtail they stooped on repeatedly.<br/><br/>Another highlight of Hawk Hill ornithological oddness today was a weird gang attack of three Ravens on one Raven.  Or possibly it was just one Raven on one Raven with three others egging him on.  This took place around 1 pm, on the west platform, within 4 feet of a tourist: one Raven standing on another, pecking at its body with its beak.<br/><br/>The birds continued throughout the day until 2 pm when the fog swamped us from the West, and we called it a day.<br/>A special nod to the late John Lennon who turns 80 years young today, and wrote admiringly about birds of prey in his song, "For the Benefit of Mr. Kite."<br/>

<p>Started a little late with the safety tailgate at 10 am, count start at 1030, as Hawk Hill emerged from the fog. We recommend checking the "Mt Tam Cam" along with the Crissy Field "East Beach Cam" for synthesizing a reasonable true picture of fog conditions on Hawk Hill.<br/><br/>Fog retreated to the Rodeo Lagoon area by noon but started to fill back in, swamping the Hill from the west by 2 pm.<br/><br/>Highlights of the day were several mixed kettles of raptors, mostly Broadwings, TVs, and Redtails, with a few accips thrown in. Most were in the warmest local bubble, the ridge west of Kirby Cove, which seemed to produce good thermals throughout the mid day.  At least one or two adult Cooper's Hawks came through, plus an adult dark dark morph Broadwing, likely the same one seen Oct 5th.<br/>

<p>The morning started with a dense fog layer obstructing the Golden Gate Bridge and Hawk Hill. We delayed our start time and weren't feeling too optimistic about our chances of counting today. But by 10:30, the fog was starting to sink and blue skies were peaking out above Hawk Hill. The team met at noon and began counting at 12:30 pm. A short day, but a lot of good movement to be seen - a great day for Broad-winged Hawks. Highlight was a dark morph adult Broadwing that hung around and gave the team a few good looks!  <br/>

An average flight of the four "regulars" -- Redtail, Sharpshin, Coop, and TVs,  Highlights included several gangs of Broad-winged Hawks moving high across the eastern sky using Slacker Ridge for lift. A juv Golden that first appeared against the south face of Mt Tam, but came in and out of view for 30 mins until it appeared near the GG Bridge, also following the Slacker Ridge line.

<p>The team postponed our meeting time due to thick fog, and was feeling optimistic when patches of blue sky started breaking through the dense wall of fog at the Headlands and Golden Gate Bridge around 9 am. The team met at 10:30 am, greatly anticipating our first official count day together, but unfortunately, the fog never broke at Hawk Hill and there was no official count today. There was, however, lots of great raptor activity seen by volunteers and staff east of Hawk Hill at the Annex. 8 species were spotted, including 7 Merlins! Hoping for clear skies and many great raptors for the rest of the week!<br/>

<p>Today's first Hawkwatch count started with fog threatening to obstruct the count. Light winds in the morning which weren't good for any bird movement on the hill began to improve after an hour or more and so did the birds.

<p>Hawkwatch did not officially count today as we are in our step up phase and counting only three days a week. Tomorrow's forecast looks better for air quality and visibility, so we did not count but worked with the data equipment. While spending an hour at the wingspans working with the data collection devices raptors seemed to be on the move with mainly juvenile Sharp-shinned and Red-tailed Hawks. Prairie Falcon and Golden Eagle were the stand out sightings of the hour/day. <br/>

<p>"Dear Hawkwatchers, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole migration to be watched for whatever reason you deemed fit, but we think you're crazy for wanting us to fly close so you can tell us who we are. You see us as you want to see us, in the simplest terms, in the most convenient identifications. But what we found out, is that in each one of us is a Sharpie, and a Merlin, and a Red-tailed Hawk, a Roughie, and a Turkey Vulture. Does that answer your ID datasheet? Sincerely yours, The Raptor Club." Signing out for an awesome season! From all of us to you, we wish everyone happy holidays and many more raptor filled days!<br/>

<p>As the Saturday II team was preparing to leave for Hawk Hill, we felt small droplets of rain on our faces. Moments later, the droplets became a drizzle, so we dashed back inside the office to seek shelter. With the rain showing no signs of letting up, we decided to have our end of the season potluck inside! Despite the dismal weather, everyone had a great time reflecting on the season's highlights and sharing the delicious dishes brought by our amazing team members. We wish tomorrow's team better weather and thanks for a great hawkwatching season!<br/>

<p>The rain came down throughout the Bay Area today, but Hawk Hill remained dry, almost as if the clouds knew it was the Friday II team's last day. While temperatures were low, spirits were high and warm food filled our bellies from the annual potluck. With the migration season wrapping up, the flight was a slow one, yet we still had many views of Northern Harriers hunting around the hill. Two sightings of adult male Northern Harriers were had today, with these "grey ghosts" floating silently along the hillsides and even over the water. The highlight of the day came from two adult Peregrine Falcons. We first saw one, dive bombing an adult Red-tailed Hawk just off the South Platform. It then flew up into the sky and was joined by the second adult, before they both passed low over the team, one after the other. The day ended on a more solemn note, as some of our Hawkwatchers had their last day on the hill today, but we are excited to see what adventures they end up on next. Good luck for the last two teams of the season! We will see you next year.<br/>

<p>It was a frigid Thanksgiving hawkwatch, with wind chills bottoming out in the low 30s and a stiff breeze all morning. The birds were feeling the cold temperatures too, as few raptors were on the move. Perhaps it was apt that about a third of the birds we saw today were Turkey Vultures, including a flyby from our resident with tag number 368. We also saw a number of Northern Harriers, including two adult females. Though our count numbers were low, we still enjoyed our morning on the hill and the Thursday II team is sad to see the season come to a close. We wish everyone a safe and happy Thanksgiving, filled with great food and even better company! <br/>

<p>With dark rain clouds looming all around us, the Wednesday II team kept one eye on the hawks and one eye on the clouds as we started our final hawkwatch count for the season. An hour after we began, the rain finally caught up to us, so we packed up and drove back to the GGRO office. But sunshine poking through the clouds gave us new hope, and sure enough the rain had moved on just in time for lunch. We reassembled the team and returned to Hawk Hill to resume counting. When we arrived, two adult Peregrine Falcons and an adult Red-tailed Hawk greeted us with daring displays of aerial acrobatics! In the mid-afternoon, an adult male Northern Harrier was spotted below Rocky Ridge, foraging alongside an adult female. Raptor activity slowed down by the end of the count, but we were happy to be back on the hill in the sunshine nonetheless. The Wednesday II team is grateful for our resilient team members and looks forward to more raptors next fall!<br/>

<p>Today was chilly, with temperatures hovering around 48&#730;F and rain in the forecast for the afternoon. The Tuesday II team bundled up in extra layers and kicked off our last hawkwatching day with a potluck feast to warm our stomachs. A few Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures cruised along the hillside, including everyone's favorite tagged vulture, #368. Just before noon, a pair of adult Peregrine Falcons caught the attention of the East Quadrant hawkwatchers. We watched the pair weave through the cables of the Golden Gate Bridge in hot pursuit of a small black bird. In an incredible feat of agility, one Peregrine stooped over midspan and collided with its prey, snatching it out of thin air. After their successful hunt, the falcons flew back towards the base of the north tower and disappeared from view. We ended our count abruptly as it began to rain, but we were grateful to have seen some action before the weathered turned. We wish the best of luck to the rest of the hawkwatch teams as we near the end of the 2019 season!<br/>

<p>The last Monday II of the season was a beautiful day on Hawk Hill, with clear skies and a light breeze. Our count started off strong, with a good flight of both Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures dotting the sky. Mid-morning, two Peregrine Falcons were spotted stooping on one another over Land's End, putting on a show for everyone on the hill. Then, right in front of West Quadrant, a male American Kestrel appeared and fluttered past the hawkwatchers. The first of many male kestrel sightings, seeing these buoyant little falcons up close was a definite highlight of the day. As the sun began to sink, a gorgeous adult Red-tail cruised over the East Quadrant, stilling into the wind just above the hill. As if in a final salute, it tucked in its wings and gracefully glided across the path only a few feet in front of us! We're grateful for a great season together and are already looking forward to next fall!<br/>

<p>The sun was shining as the Sunday I team made its way up to Hawk Hill. With a nice breeze from the East and clear skies, we were excited yet wistful as we began our last day on the hill for this season. Despite the great conditions, it was a slow day. With only a few hours of heavy raptor activity, the team got to chat about the upcoming holidays and plan birding trips for the off season. One of the Common Ravens that so frequent the hill joined us in our potluck as it sat on Fish Rock with a tasty rabbit for lunch. The Northern Harriers were still buzzing around the hillsides and valleys, while male American Kestrels continued to hunt in the areas around the hill. One particular male was seen perched on a rock for most of the day and would return whenever he left. The Sunday I team wishes everyone a great last day of Hawkwatch as the season comes to an end, and we are excited for our next season!<br/>

<p>The Saturday I team had a beautiful day to finish off their 2019 season. It was a bright sunny day with warm temperatures and a mild breeze with a decent amount of raptor flow for late in the season. Early in the morning, the hawkwatchers in North Quadrant picked up on a White-tailed Kite moving across the ridge below the FM towers. Several hawkwatchers who had not yet seen a White-tailed Kite this year eagerly crowded onto the North platform to watch the bird as it made its way toward Sausalito. Our count today also included nine dark morph Red-tailed Hawks, whose underwing covert patterns ranged from a speckled brown to a uniform dark chocolate color. Another positive sign from today was the high number of sightings of American Kestrels, which have had surprisingly low numbers this year. We counted eleven American Kestrels, one of the highest single-day counts of the season. We also continued this season's strong run on Northern Harriers, with eighteen total sightings, including three adult females. It's been a great season of hawkwatching for the Saturday I team, and although we're sad to see the season go, we know that great things await in the coming years! <br/>

<p>After a season full of days shortened or cancelled because of weather, the Friday I team finally got up to the hill for an excellent day of hawkwatching. The sun was out all day long, temperatures fell comfortably in the 60s, and there was a light breeze throughout the day. With these great conditions came numerous great sightings. Shortly after our count began, a keen hawkwatcher picked up on a White-tailed Kite moving South just inside the Golden Gate. Just seconds after the kite disappeared from view, an Osprey appeared in the middle of the Golden Gate shipping channel, illuminated by the harsh early morning sun. About an hour later, the hawkwatchers in West quadrant picked up on a juvenile Bald Eagle flying west over Rodeo Lagoon. The Bald Eagle spent several minutes soaring with a comparatively minute adult Red-tailed Hawk before exiting to the west over Hill 88. The early hours of the afternoon were characterized by high numbers of Red-tailed Hawks, including several dark morph birds. At about 2:30 PM, the North Quadrant hawkwatchers spotted a bird hover hunting over between Fish Rock and Kremin's Crag. Unlike the Red-tailed Hawks we had been seeing throughout the afternoon, this bird had distinct white markings at the ends of its upperwings and a thick white band at the base of its tail. As the large Buteo moved through the East Quadrant, it showed off its dark belly band and carpal patches, proving that it was a juvenile Rough-legged Hawk. The whole team crowded into the North and West quadrants to watch as the Rough-legged Hawk made several passes back and forth between Hawk Hill and the FM towers before disappearing to the North. As the day was wrapping up, a second Bald Eagle was spotted over the North Tower of the Golden Gate Bridge. This bird showed almost no white in its undersides and had white feathers in its head and tail, although it still maintained a patch of dark feathers across its eye, indicating a fourth-year bird. By day's end, we had accumulated over 300 sightings of 13 different species. It was a truly sweet way to end the season and Friday I can't wait to see what next year brings!<br/>

Almost immediately after our arrival to the hill this morning, an adult Peregrine Falcon came speeding by the hill, passing just a few feet in front of the North and East Quadrant hawkwatchers. Later in the morning, the hawkwatchers in West Quadrant spotted a large raptor circling up over Rodeo Lagoon. As the bird soared, it caught the sunlight, and its bright white head and tail were unmistakable. The hawkwatchers watched in awe as the adult Bald Eagle spent several minutes circling over Point Bonita before departing to the West. After lunch, the North quadrant hawkwatchers spotted a large white bird with bowed wings soaring over the Volcano - an Osprey! The bird passed over North Slacker, showing off its characteristic M-shaped wings. As the day was wrapping up, the hawkwatchers in the West Quadrant spotted a feisty male American Kestrel divebombing an adult Red-tailed Hawk that was perched on Rocky Ridge. The Red-tailed Hawk dealt with the bombardment for a few minutes, before giving up and taking off to the Northeast. It was a terrific final day of hawkwatching for the Thursday I team, and although we're sad to see the season come to an end, we're already looking forward to what next year has in store! <br/>

<p>The Wednesday I team started our final count of the 2019 season with good visibility and strong winds from the north. A couple of Red-tailed Hawks circled Hawk Hill and several Turkey Vultures wobbled in the wind during the first hour. Shortly after 10 am, shouts of excitement from the East Quadrant drew the team's attention to a pair of Snow Geese flying low over Conzelman Road. We watched as they banked in the North Quadrant and disappeared behind a ridge. In the mid-afternoon, raptor activity had slowed to a trickle as the wind died down. Suddenly, a juvenile Bald Eagle appeared in front of Slacker Ridge and the whole team rushed over to watch it rise over the valley. The eagle continued to gain altitude until it disappeared from our view over Mt. Tam. The Red-tail flight picked up again in the last hour of our count and a small kettle formed over the Golden Gate Bridge. This small burst of activity was the perfect sendoff for the Wednesday I team!<br/>

<p>It was a gorgeous final day of the season for the Tuesday I team. The sun was shining, the wind was blowing, and birds were on the move. Throughout the day, we were perpetually surrounded by Red-tailed Hawks, which accounted for more than half of our sightings. We watched several adult Red-tailed Hawks interacting and performing undulating displays in the strong winds. The winds also brought in three White-tailed Kites, two of which cruised by Hawk Hill, showing off their dark carpal spots and charcoal-black shoulders. Shortly after noon, a juvenile Bald Eagle rose up in front of Mt. Tamalpais, much to the excitement of both the hawkwatchers and a visiting group of children from Nature Bridge. The eagle effortlessly swept over the hill, seemingly unaffected by the high winds as it made its way North over Angel Island. It was also a productive day for falcons. Throughout the day, we had sightings of eight American Kestrels, several of which came within feet of the hawkwatchers. The end of our day was punctuated by a late-afternoon adult Peregrine Falcon, which stooped several times in North quadrant before disappearing from sight. While the Tuesday I team is sad that the season has come to a close, we had a year full of great sightings and we can't wait to see what future seasons have in store. Best of luck to the rest of the teams who will be having their final hawkwatching sessions of the season in the coming days!  <br/>

<p>It was a beautiful final day of hawkwatch for the Monday I team. In the morning, a Merlin breezed by the hill and hawkwatchers in the North Quadrant watched with delight as it flew directly between them and our Dayleader! It swooped by to catch a bug and departed as quickly as it came. Later in the day, an Osprey was spotted near the North Tower of the Golden Gate Bridge. It circled up with a pair of Red-tailed Hawks and eventually made its way south. Another exciting moment came about an hour later when hawkwatchers in the East Quadrant called in an adult Ferruginous Hawk! Everyone flocked over to watch the large buteo fly up over Kirby Cove before crossing the Golden Gate. These moments contributed to an excellent last day on the hill. The Monday I team had a great season overall and wishes the other teams good luck in the final cycle of the 2019 season!<br/>

<p>Hawk Hill blessed the Sunday II team with some favorable air movement and clear skies, giving us a great flight with many close viewings. Early in the morning, a male American Kestrel popped up into the sky and flew straight towards the hill. We were delighted to see him fly close through each of the four quadrants, showing off his rufous back and steel blue wings, diagnostic of a male Kestrel. As has been seen in the recent days, we had an onslaught of Northern Harriers throughout the whole count. The high point of today, however, was a sighting of not one, but two juvenile Rough-legged Hawks. The first was seen rising above the water just in front of South Quadrant. Its dark belly next to its stark white underwings and tail were easily seen as the bird circled up. A perfect photo-op moment appeared when the large Buteo lazily soared above the Golden Gate Bridge. Our second Rough-legged Hawk was the last sighting of the day and closed our count perfectly! Seen far out over Mount Tam, its white tail gave it away as an exciting bird. It wasn't until we saw those dark carpal patches that we confirmed it was a Rough-legged Hawk. As we packed up to end the day, the raptor stuck around and flew South towards Slacker Ridge. Hope the favorable conditions continue through tomorrow, which starts our last cycle of the season!<br/>

<p>Fog filled the valley this morning, so the Saturday II team went birding at Rodeo Lagoon, eager to look for the Tri-colored Heron that has become a bit of a local celebrity for birders. We found the heron wading in the shallow water close to the bank, where we watched it catch a few sizeable fish. Blue sky broke through the fog above us, prompting us up to Hawk Hill. As we began counting, an adult Sharp-shinned Hawk flew in close from the West Quadrant and circled through all quadrants before crossing the Golden Gate. The rest of the day was slow, with negligible wind and fog clinging over the valley and ocean. Norther Harriers cruised around the hillsides, and we watched one juvenile bird pounce on a small rodent and carry it off to eat! Just before our count ended, a dashing male American Kestrel appeared from the West Quadrant and zipped towards the north, where he proceeded to kite above the Coyote Brush several times before finally catching an insect and eating it on the wing. We hope the breeze picks up for tomorrow's count!<br/>

<p>The Friday II team started the morning on a high note. Before heading up to Hawk Hill, we made a quick stop at Rodeo Lagoon to look for the Tri-colored Heron that has been hanging around in the recent weeks. We spotted it foraging in some reeds near a Great Egret and a Snowy Egret. Once up on the hill, we had a much slower morning. The breeze was low, the clouds were close, and the birds were not flying. Around noon, however, the skies cleared, and we got more hopeful. A Buteo breakout occurred, with large numbers of Red-tailed Hawks zooming towards us from Mount Tam and crossing effortlessly into San Francisco. After the initial boom of birds, out raptor stream mellowed to a nice even pace. Early afternoon brought us a Ferruginous Hawk, lazily flying over from Hill 88. It circled in West quadrant for a few moments before heading on its way. About an hour later, a male American Kestrel decided to kite in the air just in from of North Quadrant, giving us a spectacular view of this little raptor. Just as the day was beginning to wind down, fog from the west blew in and covered the hill in a blanket of clouds, causing us to stop our count one hour early. Despite the early departure, it was an exciting day up on the hill!<br/>

<p>The Thursday II team arrived this morning with high hopes for today's hawkwatch. Unlike in previous days, there wasn't a blanket of fog hanging over the Headlands. On our way up to the hill, we made a brief stop at the East end of Rodeo Lagoon to look at the recently sighted Tricolored Heron and found it nestled amongst the marsh grass. Upon our arrival to the hill, conditions were comfortable with relatively good visibility. Temperatures were in the mid-50s and there was a mild breeze. Raptor activity was minimal throughout the morning, with migrating birds few and far between. Although our count was slow, we did see three species of falcons, including an adult Peregrine Falcon stooping upon potential prey in the North Quadrant, several Male Kestrels kiting in the South and West Quadrants, and a Merlin that made a beeline for the Golden Gate Bridge after popping up below the South platform. As lunchtime rolled around, the skies darkened and rain clouds closed in quickly. By 12:30, moderate rainfall meant an early closure to our count. It's certainly been a week of strange weather, but it was nice to be up on the hill today, albeit for only a couple hours. Hopefully our last meeting will bring more forgiving weather conditions and lots of great birds!<br/>

<p>The Wednesday II team was greeted with a wall of thick fog upon arriving in the Marin Headlands this morning. Sightings of a vagrant Tri-colored Heron at Rodeo Lagoon prompted the team to turn their binoculars to the water's edge and scan for this Gulf Coast native while waiting for better weather. We were walking along the shore towards its last known location near the east end of the lagoon when a romp of otters appeared close to the bank! The otters took turns watching us closely and diving down to catch fish. Before we reached the end of the lagoon, another birder pulled his car over to let us know he had just seen the heron fly towards the beach. We followed suite, but saw only Snowy Egrets and waterfowl. Not wanting to give up so easily, we ventured back to the east end of the lagoon for one last look. From out of the reeds, the Tri-colored Heron appeared! It landed just in front of us, to our delight and amazement! We watched it snag a fish and everyone got great looks at its bluish plumage and rusty-brown neck. Energized by our successful heron hunt, we decided to drive up Hawk Hill to assess the visibility, but unsurprisingly, we were met with only denser fog. We're hopeful that our last hawkwatch day of the season will bring clearer skies! <br/>

<p><br/>It was an amazing start to the morning for the Tuesday II team when a Ferruginous Hawk appeared over Rodeo Lagoon shortly after starting our count. Its bright three points of light stood out in the distance and caught our attention. As it circled closer to Hawk Hill, we were able to get great looks at its rufous shoulders and pantaloons, field marks signifying that it was an adult bird. It soared overhead for a short while, seemingly in no rush to fly south. In the afternoon, West Quadrant spotted another surprise species: a hulking, dark bird near the Rifle Range. We caught a glimpse of its white belly and back, and its enormous dark brown wings. It was a sub-adult Bald Eagle! Amazed, the team continued to watch this large raptor circle beneath us before crossing the fog-covered bay towards the city. Just as the fog was encircling the South Quadrant, a gray ghost appeared from out of the mist. As quickly as the male harrier appeared, it vanished, before popping up in North Quadrant moments later. As the day wound down, we concluded our count with happy hearts after another great day on the hill!<br/><br/>

<p>After the fog-filled mornings of the past few days, the Monday II team was thrilled to begin our count with sunshine and good visibility. There were several Accipiters circling the hill in the morning, including a very close adult Sharp-shinned Hawk that breezed through all four quadrants. Shortly after, hawkwatchers in the North Quadrant spotted a large, steady raptor circling over Mt. Tam. As it started flying in from the northwest, we noticed its large head and plank-like wings which helped us determine that it was an eagle. It cruised over Hawk Hill and everyone got to see its brown belly and white underwing coverts - key field marks of a juvenile Bald Eagle! We watched with admiration as it continued its journey south. Afternoon flight was relatively slow, but we finished our day with an awesome sighting of a White-tailed Kite over Slacker Ridge. We are looking forward to our final day on the hill in two weeks!<br/>

<p>Stray fingers of fog lingered in the headlands this morning, but the sun broke through and the Sunday I team was able to make it up to Hawk Hill for our count. With little breeze, the day was slow but still full of excitement. Mid-day, an adult male Northern Harrier flew in lazy circles in the valley off West quadrant, accompanied by a pumpkin spice juvenile Northern Harrier that was following him around. Soon after, two boisterous male American Kestrels were sighted over the rifle range and seemed to be playing with each other. Far in the North, a juvenile Rough-legged Hawk surprised us all as it flew over the landscape. Even from a distance, the white tail shone as the bird banked in flight. Later in the day, a Merlin zoomed into view, hunting insects in the sky. We were delighted to see a successful catch and watched as the bird ate on the wing. Suddenly, the fog rushed in and enveloped the hill, causing an early end to our day, but not before the ghostly silhouette through the fog of a close Northern Harrier sent us on our way. Hope the weather clears up for tomorrow!<br/>

<p>It was another foggy morning in the Marin Headlands and hawkwatching was once again delayed by poor visibility. The Saturday I team spent the morning walking around Rodeo Lagoon, where there were several exciting raptor and non-raptor sightings. Midway through our walk, an adult Peregrine Falcon made a close run over the lagoon, before stopping on a sandbar to bathe at the water's edge. On the Eastern end of the lagoon, the hawkwatchers were greeted by an Osprey and a juvenile Northern Harrier, a good omen of the improved hawkwatching conditions to come. Our walk around the lagoon also brought several exciting non-raptor sightings, including a vocalizing Sora hiding in the marsh grass, a Surf Scoter exploring the deepest part of the lagoon, and a pair of Wilson's Snipes foraging in the mud beneath the Rodeo Lagoon Bridge. At about noon, signs of clearing skies signaled that it was time to head up to the hill. Sure enough, we were greeted by mostly clear skies in the North, East, and West quadrants, and we were able to begin our count at half-past noon. Though our count only lasted three hours, we still had some great sightings, especially in our last hour. Between 2:30 and 3:30, we spotted a juvenile Sharp-shinned Hawk harassing a male American Kestrel who was trying to relax on Kremin's Crag. Meanwhile, an adult female Northern Harrier lazily perused the hills surrounding the Coastal Trail. Just minutes before our count ended, we were treated to a great view of two adult Peregrine Falcons soaring above the North tower of the Golden Gate Bridge. Though our time on Hawk Hill was only half of what it usually is, we still enjoyed every moment of it! We look forward to seeing what's in store for our last meeting of the season in a couple weeks! <br/>

<p>The Friday I team got off to a late start because of early morning fog that didn't let up until about 11:00 AM. When we finally made it up to the hill, we were joined by the final Migratory Story group of the season. Undeterred by the residual fog, the group from John Muir Elementary School had their heart set on seeing raptors. Though there was little raptor activity throughout most of the program, a kettle of eight Red-tailed Hawks formed in front of the South tower of the Golden Gate Bridge just as the school group was prepping to leave. Several eager young hawkwatchers immediately identified these birds as Buteos because of their size and shape. The remainder of the day brought varying amounts of visibility, as fog moved in and out of the valley throughout the afternoon. However, poor visibility didn't mean a lack of excellent sightings. Shortly after noon, the hawkwatchers in the South and West quadrants were treated to the sight of a distant Osprey, who flew briefly over Rodeo Lagoon before disappearing back into the fog over the ocean. Moments later, a male American Kestrel came whizzing by the South quadrant, showing off it's gorgeous rufous tail in the harsh afternoon sunlight. As the day was winding down, we were lucky enough to spot a Merlin that preyed upon several dragonflies before zooming out of sight behind South Slacker. The day ended abruptly when fog engulfed the top of Hawk Hill just after 3:00 PM, but after several weather cancellations earlier in the season, the Friday I team enjoyed every moment of hawkwatching that we got in today! <br/>

<p>The Thursday I team had high hopes for our penultimate hawkwatching session of the season, but unfortunately the weather was not on our side. Heavy fog settled into the valley in the morning, obscuring visibility and nixing the possibility of getting up to Hawk Hill early. With hopes that it would clear later in the day, the Thursday I team opted to bird around Rodeo Lagoon. The lagoon did not disappoint - ducks, waders, and marsh-dwelling passerines abounded. Among the species we saw were Eared Grebes, Western Grebes, Ring-necked Ducks, American Wigeons, American Coots, Marsh Wrens, and Common Yellowthroats. We also spent quite a while watching a Great Egret, a young Double-Crested Cormorant, and a Great Blue Heron foraging for minnows at the water's edge. After an early lunch, the team opted to go to the top of the hill, hoping that conditions had improved enough to hawkwatch. While there were hints of blue sky around the peripheries of the headlands, Hawk Hill remained socked in and we had to call it quits. Although it wasn't the way we expected to be spending our second to last day out, we still enjoyed our observations of other Headlands avifauna and we have high hopes that our season will end on a high note in a couple weeks! <br/>

<p>Fog filled the valley this morning, so the Wednesday I team took to Rodeo Lagoon to look for waterfowl while awaiting better visibility on Hawk Hill. We saw several species of grebes swimming on the lagoon, including Western Grebes and Eared Grebes. A Surf Scoter swam solo on the far side of the lagoon, next to an American Coot wading through the reeds. Blue skies above beckoned us to caravan up to the hill. We started our count at 11 am, with good visibility around us and a small kettle of Red-tailed Hawks overhead. Just barely above a creeping layer of fog, a sub-adult Bald Eagle appeared over North Slacker! Its white belly stood out against the rest of its dark brown plumage as it soared with a Red-tailed Hawk. The fog continued to roll in and out, giving us only brief moments of clarity to scan for birds. The team remained vigilant despite the ever-encroaching fog. Eventually, the decision was made shortly after 1pm to end our count, as the fog showed no signs of retreating. The Wednesday I team is looking forward to our final day on the hill in two weeks!<br/>

<p>This morning was characterized by a pronounced inversion layer which kept Fort Cronkhite blanketed in fog. However, the Tuesday I team was pleased to find that the top of Hawk Hill was out of the fog and clear and sunny with a light breeze. Our team was grateful to have a couple extra pairs of eyes hawkwatching with us today - we had a former GGRO intern and a former hawkwatcher join us for our count today! Shortly after arriving on the hill, a juvenile Peregrine Falcon came hurtling by the hill, showing off its heavily streaked undersides and dark upperwings. In the late morning, we were lucky enough to be joined by a Migratory Story group from Paul Revere Elementary School, who excitedly watched the release of a juvenile female Sharp-shinned Hawk as part of our raptor docent program. By lunchtime, most of the fog had cleared and there was good visibility in all four quadrants. However, despite great conditions, hawk activity remained relatively slow throughout the afternoon. The definite highlight of the afternoon was an adult female and adult male Northern Harrier flying together on Rocky Ridge. The female showed off faded upperwing coverts and creamy undersides and the male gave the hawkwatchers a great look at its ghostly gray upperwings and neat white undersides. It's hard to believe that our next time out on the hill will be our last for the season, but we intend to make the most of it nonetheless! <br/>

<p>The day started with a blanket of fog covering Fort Cronkhite, but as the team made its way up to Hawk Hill, we were delighted to see blue skies overhead. Within the second hour of our count, we were surprised by a juvenile Broad-winged Hawk circling in front of the Golden Gate Bridge! These little buteos are few and far between this time of the year since their migration through the Headlands generally peaks around late September/early October. Around 11 am, we were joined by a group of students from Mission Education Center for a Migratory Story program. The students learned how to use binoculars to search for birds and were treated to a special raptor release of a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk. In the afternoon, we had a distant sighting of a juvenile Bald Eagle that soared above Angel Island and drifted across the Golden Gate. Just before the end of the day, the team had another exciting sighting when a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk popped up low in the East Quadrant. The bright white underside and face of this large buteo flashed with every turn as it drifted above Kirby Cove and gave the team a chance to admire it. While the number of overall sightings was low, the Monday I team was pleased to have high species diversity today, and we look forward to our last day out on the hill in two weeks!<br/>

<p>The haze is clearing, and the birds are flying up on Hawk Hill. The Sunday II team made their way up the hill today and were immediately greeted by a male American Kestrel flying by. As they set up, some of the hawkwatchers chatted about seeing an eagle on the drive over, so spirits were high, and people were ready. As if the birds heard us talking, a juvenile Bald Eagle emerged from behind Hill 88 and flew lazily over towards the hill, displaying white patterning in its underwing coverts. Mid-day, the team saw their second eagle of the day in the form of a juvenile Golden Eagle. Its tail had clean white on the base of each feather, indicating its status as a first-year bird. Two more Golden Eagles floated by before the day was up, both seen rather far away. The day was also full of Peregrine Falcons, both juveniles and adults. Hoping this high species count stays well into next week for the other teams to enjoy!<br/>

<h2><a name='20191102'/>Saturday, November 02, 2019</h2>
<p>It was a quiet morning on Hawk Hill. The Saturday II team was in high spirits, and mid-morning brought the first of many Red-tailed Hawk and Turkey Vulture sightings. The morning also brought the first of a handful of adult female Northern Harriers, including one individual carrying prey in its talons. A group of students from Cal State Berkeley joined us on the hill today as a fieldtrip for their Neuro-zoology class. They learned about both behavior and adaptation of raptors, before getting a close look at a passing juvenile Peregrine Falcon. Mid-day brought some excitement, as a male American Kestrel was seen diving on a wayward juvenile Red-tailed Hawk just in front of the Golden Gate Bridge. As the day moved on, several adult Sharp-shinned Hawks blew past the hill and over the bay. Their steel-blue dorsal plumage shone in the sun as they continued on with migration. All in all, it was a pleasant day in the headlands.<br/>

<h2><a name='20191101'/>Friday, November 01, 2019</h2>
<p>The Friday II team was excited when they walked on Hawk Hill today, accompanied by a breeze from the East and warm, clear skies. Two fast moving male American Kestrels zoomed by the hill within the first half hour of our count and were just as quickly identified and recorded. The rest of the morning was a little slow, with the wind staying primarily from the East, and most of the birds that were seen were far away. Between the hours of 10 and 11 am, one of those far birds turned into a Rough-legged Hawk, the third sighting of our season! As the day moved on, the winds began to come from the Northwest, and large kettles of Red-tailed Hawks filled the sky, keeping our hawkwatchers busy. The last hour of our count, however, was truly spectacular. Just after the rotation at 2:30 pm, a dark-morph adult Red-tailed Hawk flew in from the West and gave us all a great view of its chocolate belly and underwing coverts. Less than five minutes later, a large white raptor emerged from behind the South platform. The team was excited to see that it was a juvenile Rough-legged Hawk, flying close to the hill as it made its way North! The dark carpal patches were easily seen with the naked eye as this large Buteo flew past us. Soon after, an adult male Northern Harrier was seen skimming the bushes beneath North Quadrant and stayed near the hill for the rest of the hour. The grand finale of the day came from a close encounter with an adult Ferruginous Hawk! The rusty colored "leggings" of this adult were clearly seen as it floated above the hill, then left to the North in a similar manner to the Rough-legged Hawk seen just a half-an-hour earlier. Today was a truly great day, and we hope the weekend flight stays strong!<br/>

<p>It's Halloween and the Thursday II hawkwatchers were eager to see what surprises the day had in store. In the early morning, the wind was howling and birds were speeding by the hill. The high winds brought several raptors close to the hill, including multiple adult Accipiters. The males showed off their slate-blue topsides in the beaming sunlight, and several adults of both sexes gave the hawkwatchers great views of their rufous-barred undersides. However, the undisputed highlight of the morning was spotted by our hawkwatchers in South Quadrant during the 11-12 hour. Among a kettle of Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks, a large backlit bird rose up from beneath the VA Hospital. The hawkwatchers were able to see that the bird was considerably larger than the other birds with which it was kettling, but intense glare made it difficult to identify. As the bird moved toward the Golden Gate Bridge, the large raptor showed off a gorgeous white tail and head and its identity was unmistakable - an adult Bald Eagle! The cooperative eagle spent several minutes on the Southeastern side of the hill before passing 15-20 yards in front of the East Quadrant on its way north. Shortly after the Bald Eagle's departure, another large raptor arose from the Southwest, showing off clean white undersides and inky wingtips. Without hesitation, several hawkwatchers identified it as a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk. In the afternoon, winds calmed down noticeably and raptors emerged in large numbers. Between noon and 3:00 PM, we averaged well over 100 raptors per hour, including high numbers of Northern Harriers and Red-shouldered Hawks. By day's end, we had accumulated over 500 birds of 12 different species! All in all, it was a beautiful autumn day of hawkwatching. Happy Halloween to all! <br/>

<p>Walking up to Hawk Hill, we held on tightly to our hats as gusts of wind blew all around us. A pair of adult Peregrine Falcons coasted in overhead, dancing in the wind like aerial acrobats. Soon after, Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and Northern Harriers popped up from the surrounding hillsides and gained altitude quickly in the strong breeze. One dark Red-tailed Hawk caught the attention of everyone on the hill. Its body was almost jet-black, with streaks of white in its chest and on its head, and it showed wavy barring along its flight feathers. Despite having the dark trailing edge of an adult Red-tail, its tail had only a brush of red near the tip and was otherwise silvery in color. This unusual visitor was none other than a Harlan's Hawk, a sub-species of Red-tailed Hawk and a real treat for the hawkwatchers. In the spirit of Halloween Eve, an adult male Northern Harrier, or Gray Ghost, appeared in the late afternoon and circled the hill closely before disappearing as quickly as he had appeared. We can't wait to see what kind of interesting birds November brings for the Wednesday II team!<br/>

<h2><a name='20191026'/>Saturday, October 26, 2019</h2>
<p>Saturday I had a slower day today up on Hawk Hill. Haze, combined with little to no wind, stuck around the hill until about 1:30, when we finally got a nice little breeze coming in from the Southwest. With low air movement, the raptors weren't moving much, but they still gave us great views. Three juvenile Northern Harriers joined us mid-day and scuffled in the sky in front of the North quadrant platform. Their pumpkin bellies and white rump patches flashed as they twisted and turned around each other. A bit later, a Western Meadowlark landed in a tree, much to the surprise of a nearby adult Red-tailed Hawk. The hawk proceeded to chase the Meadowlark around, before flying on its way through the bay. What we lacked in raptors, we made up for in Band-tailed Pigeons, with large groups flying over the hill throughout the count. A couple of fast-moving Merlins gave us our only falcon sightings of the day as they zoomed by South Platform and hurried into the city. Overall, the team had a fun time on the hill!<br/>

<p>With PG&E's planned power outages and current wildfires, Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy is canceling all group and volunteer field programs in Marin today and actively monitoring air quality index for possible future continuance of field programs.<br/><br/>While the Friday I team wishes that we could have been up on the hill counting raptors today, we completely understand that recent heat waves and high winds make conditions unsafe for hawkwatching.  This feels especially pertinent given the smoky conditions experienced by the counters on Hawk Hill yesterday afternoon. Here's to hoping that November brings less extreme weather and a great late-season raptor flight! To all affected by the heat, by power outages, and by wildfires, please stay safe and take care! <br/>

<p>The winds were blowing up on Hawk Hill today, with gusts in the early morning approaching 30 miles per hour from the East. With the high winds came fast-moving raptors, which kept the hawkwatchers on their toes. Just after we started counting, three adult Peregrine Falcons came whipping by the hill, demonstrating their remarkable speed. In the late morning, we were joined by a Migratory Story group from Willow Creek Academy, who had a great morning of hawkwatching. During their program on the hill, they were lucky enough to see a Turkey Vulture with a patagial tag, which provided a perfect opportunity to learn about our banding and tagging programs. Before heading off at lunch time, the group got to witness the release of a female Cooper's Hawk, which stuck around the hill for a few minutes, showing off it's "flap-flap-glide" flight style. The highlight of the afternoon was a leucistic adult Red-tailed Hawk, appropriately nicknamed the "piano bird" as it displayed bright white primaries and upperwing coverts. As it took off toward Angel Island, it was joined by a dark morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawk, showing off the remarkable contrast between the two birds' pigmentation. Unfortunately, the day ended a bit early because of smoke that billowed over the hill from a fire in Richmond. Though our day ended early, we were still in high spirits! <br/>

<p>Like the past few days, our count started slowly with warm temperatures and only a light breeze. As the wind picked up, so did the raptor flight, just in time for two visiting groups of elementary school students to observe wild raptors. The Marin Horizon kindergarteners enjoyed learning all about raptor adaptations and migration with a special interactive Hawk Talk. One of our expert hawkwatchers led the other school group around Hawk Hill as they practiced recording their own sightings together. In the early afternoon, the Wednesday I team was treated to several low-flying male American Kestrels just overhead. Their bright white "strings of pearls" were clearly visible from below, and vibrant blue upperwing coverts shone in the afternoon sun. Everyone was grateful to be back on Hawk Hill for a beautiful and busy day watching hawks!<br/>

<p>The day on Hawk Hill was warm and mostly windless, but that didn't stop the Tuesday I team from having a relatively productive day. Today was a falcon frenzy, characterized by numerous falcon sightings, especially American Kestrels. By 1:00 PM, we had nine American Kestrel sightings, including eight males. Several of these small falcons were seen eating dragonflies on the wing, and one of the males made a close pass by the hill, giving today's Migratory Story group from Willow Creek Academy a wonderful look at its rufous tail and slate-blue shoulders. Additionally, there were sightings of five Merlins today, one of which was also seen picking dragonflies out of the air. Though falcon sightings tapered off in the late afternoon as windspeeds picked up, we had a couple of great sightings to finish out our day, most notably an adult female Northern Harrier, and a chocolate-brown dark morph adult Red-tailed Hawk. The Tuesday I team wasn't scared off by the heat and we look forward to seeing what November has to offer! <br/>

<p>It was a relatively slow day on Hawk Hill for the Monday I team. There was not much wind in the morning, so the raptor flow seemed to be minimal. As the day continued, we observed many of our usual suspects in addition to a striking White-tailed Kite and a close-flying male American Kestrel. Even with a lack of activity during some moments throughout the day, our hawkwatchers stayed focused on the skies and their vigilance payed off when a surprise visitor emerged in the West Quadrant... A large bird with long, broad wings and round face popped up in the west and immediately grabbed the attention of everyone on the hill. We quickly identified it as a Short-eared Owl and watched in awe as it flew into the vegetation below the hill. This was an especially exciting moment for the team since we do not see many of these nocturnal raptors during our count! Overall, the team had another productive and delightful day of hawkwatching.<br/>

<p>The fog is gone! Sunday II enjoyed a clear day today with a slight breeze coming in from the North. Though the morning was slow, a small pick up in the breeze brought more raptors as the day went on. During our weekly Sunday Hawk talk, a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk flew over the talk right as the group was learning about Buteos. This allowed the visitors to not only see a gorgeous bird, but to see the big wings and tail of a Buteo! About an hour later, the North Quadrant followed a subadult Bald Eagle as it made its way towards Hawk Hill, then moved on through the bay. Towards the end of the day, a Merlin appeared in the South Quadrant. In true Merlin fashion, this fearless raptor was seen repeatedly diving on a juvenile Cooper's Hawk that was flying by. A close White-tailed Kite closed out the day perfectly, with its white wings unmistakable as it flew within a kettle of Turkey Vultures. We are hoping for more great birds as the season moves on!<br/>

<p>For the second day in a row, the weather didn't favor the counters on Hawk Hill. The day started off with decent visibility in most of the quadrants, although ominous clouds settled overhead as the morning went on. By late morning, winds from the west brought cold temperatures and fog to the hill. The unquestionable highlight of the day was an adult male Northern Harrier, which spent the morning patrolling the hills below North Quadrant. Just before the fog fully enveloped the hill, a male American Kestrel alit on a pole below the Hawk Hill parking lot, giving the hawkwatchers a lengthy view of its rufous and blue plumage. Between 12:30 and 1:00 PM, the hill was totally engulfed in fog, and the Saturday II team reluctantly called off our count early. Here's to hoping for more forgiving weather next time around! <br/>

<p>With decent visibility and a good amount of breeze from the North, the Friday II team was excited to begin our day up on Hawk Hill. A Merlin started our morning full of excitement, however the flow of raptors was slow today. A male Sharp-shinned Hawk lets its presence be known during a raptor release today for a school group participating in our Migratory Story program. The kids were very excited to see a raptor up close and to use their new identification skills that they have been learning. The fog and the clear sky battled each other all morning, but the fog ultimately won, causing the team to call it a day and leave the hill around 1. Hopefully this fog doesn't stick around much longer!<br/>

<p>The Thursday II team got off to a great start with a decent amount of raptor activity in the morning. Within the first hour of our count, an adult Peregrine Falcon popped up close to the hawkwatchers in North Quadrant and gave everyone a great view before zooming west. The remainder of the morning was full of Northern Harriers and Cooper's Hawks with a few Red-shouldered Hawks mixed in. Excitement picked up in the afternoon when a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk cruised over Hawk Hill on its way south. At the same time, one of our keen-eyed hawkwatchers picked up on a Golden Eagle heading the same way. Both large raptors crossed the Golden Gate and continued on their migration. We wrapped up the day with a salvo of Peregrine Falcons - 3 adults and a juvenile! They entertained us with their vocalizations as they impressively stooped on an unsuspecting Red-tailed Hawk and one another. It was another wonderful day of hawkwatching and the team looks forward to our next day out together on Halloween!<br/><br/>

<p>The morning was overcast, with barely a breeze to be felt from atop Hawk Hill. Aside from the resident ravens, we saw very few birds flying until closer to 11 am, when the flight picked up and Sharp-shinned Hawks began to pop out from behind the hills and clouds. Mixed in with the flurries of juvenile Accipiters were handfuls of silvery-blue adult birds, which stood out against the landscape. To our delight, several White-tailed Kites flew in close to Hawk Hill, showing off their brilliant white plumage and charcoal-black shoulder patches, before continuing their journey southward. Interspersed between the kite sightings, the hawkwatch team was kept busy by multiple dark morph Red-tailed Hawks flying overhead through the '5th Quadrant.' By 2:30 pm, fog encircled the hill and we lost most of our visibility in the South Quadrant. We ended the day with a buzzer-beating juvenile Northern Harrier and we can't wait to be back in two weeks!<br/>

<p>The valley was blanketed in fog when we arrived, so the Tuesday II team decided to bird on the beach and the lagoon while waiting for the skies to clear. We spotted two adult Cooper's Hawks perched around Fort Cronkhite, which sparked a group discussion about the differences in plumage between adult and juvenile Accipiters. Around noon, blue sky appeared over Hill 88, so the team raced for Hawk Hill to start counting raptors. An hour into our count, two Buteos soared in from the north and caught our attention. We watched them circle each other and realized that one bird was dwarfed by the other and lacked patagial markings - a Broad-winged Hawk! Its traveling companion turned out to be an adult Red-tailed Hawk, which gave the team an excellent opportunity to compare the two species. Towards the end of the afternoon, Hawk Blind called us over the radio asking if we wanted to participate in another Raptor ID Study. When the released bird popped into view, we found ourselves stumped by the dark and fast-moving raptor, scrambling to keep eyes on it though the brush. All field marks pointed to a Merlin, yet, based upon today's flight, it was most likely a Sharp-shinned Hawk... we recorded it as a Merlin and waited with bated breath for the reveal from the banding team. It was indeed a Merlin!! The team was delighted to end the day on such a positive note, and we look forward to our next day out on Hawk Hill!<br/>

<h2><a name='20191014'/>Monday, October 14, 2019</h2>
<p>It was an exciting day on Hawk Hill today! While the morning started hazy and slow, the wind soon picked up and encouraged some late-morning flurries of raptors. The Monday II team was joined by members of the Mendocino Coast Audubon Society around noon and enjoyed sharing the afternoon flight with them. There were many juvenile Northern Harriers that popped up around the hill throughout the day and everyone got great views of their pumpkin undersides as they weaved and wobbled across the hillsides. However, the most exciting moments of the day began in the late afternoon when the hawkwatchers in the East Quadrant noticed an odd-looking Buteo in Slacker Saddle. They alerted the rest of the team with excitement and it was determined to be a juvenile Rough-legged Hawk! We watched as it circled over Angel Island, exhibiting the bright white base of its tail and dark carpal patches before zipping towards San Francisco. Just minutes later another special Buteo popped up in the west over Rodeo Lagoon and came in close over Hawk Hill. It was a dark-morph juvenile Broad-winged Hawk! The team watched with delight as the dark little Buteo soared right over our heads. Just when we thought the day couldn't get any better, another Rough-legged Hawk was identified by a hawkwatcher in the North Quadrant and the team got an even longer look at the unique features of this arctic migrant. Each day on Hawk Hill brings something new!<br/>

<p>While day 1 of Fleet Week brought the heat, day 2 was considerably cooler. A White-tailed Kite flying over the ocean welcomed us to Hawk Hill early in our count. The white wings and charcoal grey shoulders of the kite are always a wonderful sight to see. As the day went on, the fog crept back in and slowly tried to envelop the hill. A female American Kestrel proved to us that you can still count in the fog, however, as she perched on a rock right next to North quadrant, giving a clear view of her orange plumage. The fog took over most of the hill in the late afternoon, but East quadrant stayed clear, allowing visitors and hawkwatchers alike to view the airshow while scanning for raptors. The planes said goodbye to us as we packed our gear, and we are excited for our next time out!<br/>

<p>The heat was on for Fleet Week, literally and figuratively. Temperatures on the hill climbed well into the 80s and lots of eager plane watchers came up to the hill to join the hawkwatchers. Neither the raptors nor the air show disappointed. In the late morning, an Osprey made a close pass by the West Quadrant, where it remained for several minutes before lazily soaring north over Mt. Tamalpais. The warm day also brought lots of Red-tailed Hawks, including five dark morph juveniles. One of the dark morphs passed directly over the hill, showing off its heavily spotted underwings to the hawkwatchers below. The day also brought a large diversity of migrating passerines, including high numbers of Violet-green Swallows and White-throated Swifts, as well as a smattering of Ruby-crowned Kinglets, which were among the first sighted this season. The day culminated with a great showing from the Blue Angels, which delighted all of the spectators on the hill. The Saturday I team can't wait to be hawkwatching again in a couple weeks! <br/>

<p>It was another sunny and clear day up at Hawk Hill! The morning started off with high winds coming from the North Quadrant but gave way as the day continued. This brought us plenty of close birds including many Accipiters and quite a few Peregrine Falcons.  It was also a great day for Northern Harriers with 13 individuals crossing our path throughout the count. Today also marked the first day of the Fleet Week Celebration! The team was delighted by a perfect viewing of the Blue Angels in the late afternoon. The Friday I team was excited to be up on the hill after several fog days earlier in the season. We're hopeful for many more days just like this one!<br/>

<p>Though the forecast today brought fog and high winds, the Tuesday I team wasn't deterred. In the early morning, there was a pronounced inversion layer with low-hanging fog obscuring visibility in the Southern and Eastern Quadrants. However, by late morning most of the fog had cleared and there was good visibility in all of the quadrants. We were joined this morning by a Migratory Story group from Malcolm X school, who spent their time on the hill identifying passing raptors and watching the release of a juvenile Cooper's Hawk. We were also lucky enough to be joined by a group of birders from Marin County Parks, who spent a couple hours hawkwatching with us. Though the fog crept back into the valley in the afternoon, we were still greeted by several excellent sightings. Just after lunchtime, a juvenile Golden Eagle emerged from the fog, effortlessly soaring North despite strong headwinds. After the eagle departed, we also spotted a White-tailed Kite and an adult male Northern Harrier, or "gray ghost," which seemed to materialize out of the fog. The afternoon also brought a wave of male American Kestrels, including three that appeared in rapid succession as the day was winding up. Though the fog eventually engulfed the hill at about 15:00, we were still more than satisfied with the days sightings!<br/>

<p>The Monday I team had another great day of hawkwatching with clear skies and warm temperatures. Raptors certainly weren't the only organisms flying above and around Hawk Hill today. The team counted hundreds of Vaux's Swifts, Violet-green Swallows, and a variety of dragonfly species. As expected, there were plenty of Accipiters popping up around the hill, which kept the hawkwatchers on their toes. It was also a great day for Broad-winged Hawk and Northern Harrier sightings, with both numbers being in the double digits. In the afternoon, we were thrilled to watch a kettle of Broad-winged Hawks form and circle above the mid-span of the Golden Gate Bridge. Throughout the day, a few raptors made closer appearances on the hill, and the team got great looks at a White-tailed Kite, an Osprey, and even a little Merlin! With migration picking up, we can't wait to see what the coming weeks have in store.<br/>

<p>Sunny and clear skies welcomed the Sunday II team to Hawk Hill today. High winds from the North-East blew most of the day, but that didn't stop the birds, with a season high of 692 sightings. In the morning, an adult Cooper's Hawk flew close to West quadrant, giving the whole hill a great view of its rufous barred chest. Mid-day, visitors to the hill got to see another Cooper's Hawk up close, at our docent-led raptor release. The day closed out nicely with a far-away first-year Golden Eagle, and many falcons, including an adult Peregrine Falcon that flew in a close circle around the hill. The birds are flying and we're excited! Good luck to the rest of the hawkwatching teams this upcoming week.<br/>

<p>It was a beautiful day on Hawk Hill with great visibility and warm temperatures all day. Though wind patterns were inconsistent throughout the day, we still saw over 400 birds of 12 different species. The best sightings from the morning included a juvenile Bald Eagle, which soared over Mt. Tamalpais before making a very close pass over the hill, giving the hawkwatchers a great look at its skeleton-like underwings. We also had a juvenile Osprey come in very close to the hill, showing off beautiful brown and white scalloping in its upperwings.  In the late morning, we were joined by Golden Gate Audubon, who stuck around for today's Hawk Talk and some early afternoon hawkwatching. As they were preparing to head out, the banders caught a male Cooper's Hawk, which we released for them as part of our raptor docent program. The highlight of the afternoon was a pair of adult Red-shouldered Hawks, showing off beautiful crimson upperwing and underwing coverts, and bright white crescents in their wings. Though we didn't have tons of birds today, we still had some great sightings and we can't wait to see what's in store in a couple weeks!  <br/>

<p>It was a beautiful and busy day up at Hawk Hill! The morning started off clear and continued to warm up as the day went on. The team and visitors were delighted with a raptor release which featured a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk. The hawk decided to stick around for a bit longer and gave us a great viewing from the East quadrant. Later in the day, a male American Kestrel decided to show off its hunting abilities by catching an insect mid-air and eating it on the wing. The day sped by, just like many of the falcons that graced our presence today, and we soon reached 609 raptor sightings, the highest of the season!

<p>The morning started off clear and windless, with comfortable temperatures in the high 50s and low 60s and terrific visibility. In the late morning, we were joined by a Migratory Story group from a local elementary school. The kids showed off their knowledge of identifying various groups of raptors and were lucky enough to see the release of a female Sharp-shinned Hawk before they took off at lunchtime. In the afternoon, winds picked up considerably, and so too did raptor activity. The whipping winds from the North and West brought in many small kettles of Accipiters and Red-tailed Hawks. We were also lucky enough to spot several of our less common raptors - an Osprey passing low beneath the West quadrant, male and female American Kestrels zipping over Fish Rock, and a handful of Broad-winged Hawks crossing over the Golden Gate Bridge on their way south. The busy afternoon gave us high hopes for increased raptor activity in the coming days!  <br/>

<p>Another clear day on Hawk Hill today with plenty of sunshine, yet barely any breeze and occasional bursts of raptor activity. Together with education staff from the Crissy Field Center, we held a Migratory Story program for students from the Edwin and Anita Lee School. Full of energy, the students learned to recognize the shapes of the different raptor groups and eagerly scanned the skies for birds to tally on their clipboards. Before departing, they had the awesome opportunity to observe a raptor release of a juvenile Sharp-shinned Hawk and together we wished the bird well on the rest of its migration. From North Quadrant, a dark morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawk was spotted soaring above Rocky Ridge. To the excitement of the photographers on the hill, this bird was anything but camera shy, as it slowly rose overhead and gave everyone great looks at its heavily streaked underbelly. In addition to seeing a few other dazzling birds, including a low-flying young Peregrine Falcon, we were lucky to spot two Humpback whales breaching out in the mouth of the bay. Looking forward to our next day on the hill! <br/>

<p>The skies were clear of fog and raptors as we started our count this morning. A noisy flock of Cedar Waxwings buzzed over the hill, entertaining the hawkwatchers with their boisterous chatter. The Accipiter flight picked up in the early afternoon, along with some other exciting species. Soaring between a group of Turkey Vultures loomed an enormous, plank-winged raptor. With the whole team working the mystery bird, it suddenly banked and flashed its clean white tail with a dark subterminal band - it was a juvenile Golden Eagle! Within the last half an hour of the count, a White-tailed Kite appeared over Rodeo Lagoon and soared with two young Sharp-shinned Hawks. Moments later, a flash of blue and orange caught our eye: a male American Kestrel swooped through the West Quadrant and became our first falcon sighting of the day. Even though we only saw sparse flurries of birds at a time, we were thrilled to get a diversity of species over the course of the day.<br/>

<p>We caravanned up to Hawk Hill with the banding teams bright and early to begin our raptor count shortly after 9am. Visibility was excellent in all quadrants, and there was a refreshing breeze blowing off the ocean. A young Broad-winged Hawk nearly slipped past us, until a keen-eyed hawkwatcher noticed it lacked a Red-tail's dark patagial marks. Around mid-morning, South Quadrant spotted a large whale feeding in the Golden Gate. The whale's shorter and more rounded dorsal fin clued us in to the species: Humpback! Seabirds swarmed the water's surface every time the whale emerged until eventually the whale had its fill and disappeared. Just as the afternoon flight of raptors seemed to be slowing down, two juvenile Golden Eagles soared into view from over Sausalito Ridge! We got some incredible looks at the white patches in their primaries and clean white tails with dark subterminal bands. Moments later, another eagle appeared over Angel Island and cruised along Slacker Ridge. However, this eagle sported a dirty white head and tail, large yellow beak, and lacked white in its primaries - a sub-adult Bald Eagle! We felt very lucky to have the chance to compare the plumages and features of these two impressive raptor species as we wrapped up another great day of hawkwatching.<br/>

<p>Clear skies and a breeze from the south welcomed the Sunday I team up to Hawk Hill for a busy morning of counting. The hill was visited by many birds and people, as multiple bird-watching groups joined us for part of the day. An Osprey came out of the North Quadrant and flew close over the hill, giving both the hawkwatchers and visitors a wonderful view of this large raptor. Within the next hour, 3 adult Peregrine Falcons gave a close show for visitors waiting for the Sunday hawk talk, at which a juvenile male Cooper's Hawk wowed the crowd during a raptor release. The day slowed down into the afternoon, but a far juvenile Golden Eagle closed the day out perfectly. We are excited to see what the next days hold!<br/>

<p>There was a lot of hustle and bustle on Hawk Hill today - tons of people and birds were on the move. We were joined on the hill by several local birding groups, who gave us some extra pairs of eyes on a busy day of hawkwatching. The first highlight of the day was a partially leucistic adult Red-tailed Hawk, whose dorsal side resembled the keys on a piano. We were also lucky enough to see two juvenile Ferruginous Hawks today, one of which came overhead in the middle of today's hawk talk! The bird's clean white undersides and "three points of light" were on clear display for all to see. Today was also a busy day for falcons - a dozen Merlins and 8 Peregrine Falcons were sighted throughout the day. We also had a decent movement of Broad-Winged Hawks today, including a dark morph juvenile. All in all, it was a great day of hawkwatching, with more than 500 birds of 13 different species seen today. Both of those figures are seasonal highs thus far. May the good weather and abundant migration continue for many days to come!<br/>

<p>Despite foggy skies in the early morning, the Friday I team still got up to the hill early with hopes of having a productive day of hawkwatching. For the first hour of counting, conditions looked promising - the low-hanging fog in the valley lifted and there was good visibility in the East, South, and West quadrants. Unfortunately, at about 10:30, winds from the West blew the fog back in and it didn't end up clearing for the remainder of the day. While we waited for the fog to clear, we were lucky enough to see a couple of American Kestrels that made quick passes over the hill before disappearing into the fog again. We also saw a few adult Red-tailed Hawks hugging the low brush beneath the southern platform, looking for prey below. Though our day of counting ended up being short, we still had a great time up on the hill and we're optimistic about having better conditions in two weeks!<br/>

<p>Hawk Hill was surrounded by fog when we arrived this morning, so we patiently waited for the sun to bring us enough visibility to begin our count. The birds must have shared our patience, because just as the fog lifted, our first raptor appeared from the mist: a Merlin! Shortly after, we spotted our first of many flocks of nomadic Band-tailed Pigeons - we ended up counting almost 300 Band-tails over the course of the day. Multiple juvenile Northern Harriers bobbed and weaved their way around the Headlands, adding a little pumpkin spice to this blustery autumn day. We watched as two young harriers snaked their way below Rocky Ridge, just barely skimming the top of the Coyote Brush as they concentrated on hunting. We invited several Nature Bridge school groups to watch for raptors with us and discussed the significance of long-term ecological studies. The students were eager to spot passing birds, and even got a close look at a male American Kestrel as it flew overhead. The team had a fun day and we can't wait to get back up on the hill next time!<br/>

<p>We started our raptor count with clear skies and a light breeze from the east. Within only a few minutes, we heard the distinctive, raspy calls from two pairs of adult Red-tailed hawks that were circling above Kirby Cove. Among the Red-tails was a juvenile Broad-winged Hawk that soared at eye-level along the hill before gliding overhead and giving everyone great looks at its pale underwings and streaky breast. It was a premonition of what was to come... We were delighted by the appearances of several more Broad-winged Hawks throughout the day, including a dark morph and an adult - sporting its signature black and white tail! To our surprise, we spotted multiple adult birds of several species, including a Swainson's Hawk, Red-shouldered Hawk, dark morph Red-tailed Hawk, Northern Harrier, Cooper's Hawk, and Sharp-shinned Hawk. It was a great learning opportunity for the team to compare the plumages of the adult birds with our usual flight of juveniles. By the early afternoon, we lost our cool breeze and had to end our count early due to the heat. Nonetheless, we are grateful for an exciting day of hawkwatching and wish tomorrow's team some cooler weather!<br/>

<p>It was a hot day up on Hawk Hill today, as temperatures wavered in the upper 80's for most of the day. Wind was scarce in the morning, but picked up in the afternoon, which both cooled us off and brought in more birds for us to count. Visibility was excellent all day, as we could even see the ocean beyond the Farallon Islands. There was a fair amount of Accipiter movement to keep us on our toes. Both Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks flew in close to the hill and gave us great looks. We also had a relatively good day for Merlins and Red-shouldered Hawks, of which we saw a handful of each species. We were hoping to see Broad-winged Hawks, but we didn't spot a single one today. In addition to the migrating raptors, there were flocks of migrating passerines flying overhead, including: Vaux's and Black Swifts, Lesser Goldfinches, Band-tailed Pigeons, Cedar Waxwings, Say's Phoebes, and Blue-gray Gnatcatchers. Hoping for an equally busy and productive day for our next time hawkwatching!<br/>

<p>After a foggy start to our morning, the Monday I team was eager to count some raptors. Once on the hill, we immediately jumped into action since there were many hawks already flying in the clear skies surrounding Hawk Hill. The day was filled with plenty of Accipiters that would pass through in subsequent bursts. We were excited to observe several Broad-winged Hawks, and even got to see a dark morph individual! Another highlight of the day occurred in the early afternoon when hawkwatchers in the West Quadrant spotted a Merlin zoom right over the hill. It came in close and gave us a great view before quickly flying towards the Golden Gate Bridge. While the day was fast-paced, the team stayed on top of everything with good communication and determination. We are grateful for another productive day of hawkwatching!<br/>

<p>Fog surrounded Hawk Hill today and did not release its grip in time for the Sunday II team to make a count. While initially hopeful after the sunny days of this past week, the team drove up to the Hill to wait out the fog. Small patches of sun greeted us, but Southern winds brought more fog that enveloped the Hill. As we drove back down to the office, a small group of raptors flew next to the road, allowing the team to see a Red-tailed Hawk and some Accipiters. Hopefully the sun returns and this next week is full of raptors!<br/>

<p>It was a hot one on the hill today and the raptors were on the move. The Saturday II team had a busy day on the hill, with our total number of raptor sightings approaching 500. We were lucky enough to see ten species, including three species of falcon. Three Merlins were seen from the hill today, and there were also sightings of Peregrine Falcons and American Kestrels of both sexes. Other highlights from the day include two Osprey, two juvenile Red-shouldered Hawks and several juvenile Northern Harriers.

<p>Today held clear skies across the bay, giving the Friday II team a warm and wonderful day up on Hawk Hill. Starting off strong, the team saw a Merlin around 9:45 that flew right over the top of the hill and then dove after some prey! While it did not catch what it was aiming for, it was exciting to see the fierce little hunter in action. An adult Red-shouldered Hawk was seen flying low in the North Quadrant, with its vibrant red body and stark black-and-white patterning on its wings. The most exciting bird of the day, however, was an adult Swainson's Hawk. It flew right over the silhouettes, giving the whole team a clear view of the bird's dark flight feathers and dark bib. Hoping for another great day tomorrow!<br/>

<p>It was a gorgeous day on Hawk Hill - great visibility, temperatures in the 60s and 70s, and a slight breeze. Because of the excellent conditions, we had plenty of neat avian visitors, both raptor and non-raptor. Our very first sighting of the day was a White-tailed Kite, which hung out for a few minutes over Middle Kingdom before making a very close pass over the hill. It ended up being the first of four kites we saw today, all of which came in relatively close to the hill, much to the delight of the Thursday II hawkwatchers. Later in the morning, we got a terrific view of two adult Peregrine Falcons, which came over the hill chattering and stooping upon one another. Our morning also brought some excellent non-raptor migrants, including three Black Swifts. Our day was capped off by a small flurry of falcons, including a male American Kestrel, which made a quick pass over the hill on his way south and a late afternoon Merlin, which spent several minutes circling the North Tower of the Golden Gate Bridge. All in all, it was a great day of hawkwatching! We're looking forward to meeting again in two weeks, when the heart of peak should be upon us!<br/>

<p>To the surprise of both the Hawkwatch and Banding teams, we found ourselves caught in a light rain shower right as we were preparing to leave. Donning raincoats and binoculars, we braved the rain and started birding around the lagoon while waiting for the weather to improve. We spotted a Great Egret fishing alongside a Snowy Egret as we crossed the footbridge onto the beach. A family of Western Bluebirds flitted around the sand, stopping to snatch up small insects. The interns returned to the office to host a visiting group of 5th graders from St. Andrew's School and gave them a presentation on the GGRO's mission and the science of raptor migration. Meanwhile, the rest of the Wednesday II team hiked around the lagoon looking for more birds. They saw one Turkey Vulture, two Red-tailed Hawks, and a Great Horned Owl sleeping in a nearby Eucalyptus tree! The fog refused to lift from Hawk Hill, so we ended our day early, but we have our fingers crossed for better weather in two weeks.<br/>

<p>We had clear skies today for the Tuesday II team thanks to a break from the recent fog. Although the morning started off calm and quiet, the breeze soon picked up from the west and carried all types of raptors with it. From Point Bonita, a bright and flashy raptor caught our attention - our team's first White-tailed Kite sighting this season. Several juvenile Red-shouldered Hawks were spotted soaring up above the North Quadrant in the company of Cooper's Hawks and Red-tailed Hawks. We were fortunate to participate in 6 raptor ID studies over the course of the day, which challenged our Accipiter ID skills and generated great discussions. Students from George Moscone Elementary School visited Hawk Hill today as part of their Migratory Story program. The students practiced hawkwatching, experienced a raptor release, and left the hill buzzing with enthusiasm. As the day wound down, the birds kept on coming right up until the end of the official count. Overall, we had a great day of hawkwatching on the hill!<br/>

<p>With a decent amount of fog covering the Marin Headlands this morning, we prepared to start watching for hawks near the roundabout on Conzelman Road. Once we reached the base of Hawk Hill, we realized that the sky was clearing overhead, so we made our way to the top to begin our official raptor count. The day was windy with mostly clear skies and plenty of Accipiters to test our ID skills. Fog rolled in a little after noon and completely engulfed the hill by 1:30 pm, which caused us to suspend our count. Feeling defeated by the seemingly never-ending fog, we began preparing to pack up for the day. Just as we were debriefing on the day's hawkwatch, we noticed a small break in the fog that expanded over the course of a few minutes and allowed us to see Rodeo Lagoon in the west and Slacker Hill in the north. With hopeful hearts, we decided to start our count again for the remaining hours of the afternoon. Our perseverance was rewarded with a late-afternoon flurry of raptors, including two Peregrine Falcons! We were glad to finish strong, despite the brief fog intermission.<br/>

<p>With the sunshine over the past few days initially giving Saturday I high hopes, the weather ultimately changed, causing the team to have a short day out on Hawk Hill. Low fog in the morning hung over Fort Cronkhite, and the team went hiking around Rodeo Lagoon. A couple of Fox Sparrows delighted us with a close viewing as they jumped around in the bushes near the trail. The River Otters were out today as well, playing in the lagoon and splashing around. Around noon the team headed up to the hill as the clouds lifted, giving visibility to each of the quadrants. The fog stayed away long enough to give us the first docent-lead raptor release of the season with a female Cooper's Hawk! She flew off into the fog as it enveloped Hawk Hill once again, cutting the day short. Hopefully the sun shines bright for tomorrow's team!<br/>

<p>It was a scorcher up on Hawk Hill today. By the time we arrived on the hill at about 9:30 AM, temperatures at the hill's summit had climbed past 85 degrees and there was little wind to speak of. By noon, we were experiencing temperatures in excess of 90 degrees, so the Friday I team made a unanimous decision to call off our count early to avoid dehydration and heat stroke. The birds were feeling the heat too - many of our sightings were kettles of birds rising on thermals high above the hill. However, despite our relatively brief count, we still saw more than 120 birds of 6 different species, including a distant Osprey in the middle of the morning and an-eleventh hour Merlin that circled over Mt. Tamalpais as we were getting ready to call it a day. Here's to hoping that temperatures chill out soon so that we can be comfortable during our peak season hawk watches! Until then, stay cool and drink lots of water! <br/>

<p>Clear skies gave the hawkwatchers of Thursday I a 360-degree view around Hawk Hill as far out as the Farallons. The temperature steadily climbed as the day went on, and the raptors followed the warm updrafts high into the sky, making the "fifth" quadrant overhead busy all day. The steady flight of Accipiters continued from yesterday, as we spotted more Sharp-shinned Hawks. A light breeze from the South brought a young Broad-winged Hawk into view in front of the Golden Gate Bridge. A high-flying Northern Harrier snuck in among a small kettle of Red-tailed Hawks overhead. Not used to seeing Northern Harriers from so far below, the team relied on the bird's long tail, pointed wings, and deep wingbeats to identify it. Raptors were not the only exciting part of the day, as a Townsend's Solitaire breezed over Hawk Hill. Tomorrow's forecast calls for even warmer temperatures, so if you are planning on joining us on the hill, pack extra water and dress for success!<br/>

<p>The morning was slow for raptor sightings, but the insects and other bird species were already on the move around Hawk Hill. We were thrilled to see two Monarch Butterflies within our first hour on the hill. We also spotted several Blue-gray Gnatcatchers, White-throated Swifts, Vaux's Swifts, a Great Egret, and a Red-breasted Nuthatch! Suddenly, a male American Kestrel appeared out of the fog in South Quadrant and soared overhead, showing off the bright white "string of pearls" on the trailing edge of his wings. Throughout the day, several distant mixed-species kettles tested our raptor ID knowledge and gave us the opportunity to use teamwork to successfully identify and pass the birds from quadrant to quadrant. A White-tailed Kite dropped in for a visit around lunchtime, and we watched it soar above the Golden Gate Bridge and disappear into the San Francisco skyline. With a westerly wind came an abundance of accipiters, which rekindled the age-old "Sharpie or Coop?" dilemma, but also provided an excellent learning experience for everyone on the hill. We had a busy and exciting day today and are looking forward to even more raptors as the migration picks up in the coming weeks!<br/>

<p>Today was sunny and warm, with clear views as far as the Geysers in the North and Mt. Diablo in the East. Shortly after unpacking at the hill, we were greeted by fleeting glimpses of a bobcat that disappeared into the chaparral around Fish Rock. As the morning went on, the birds took to the skies, and we saw Osprey, a few juvenile Sharp-shinned Hawks, Cooper's Hawks, and even a gliding adult Peregrine Falcon. A large group of energetic young students from Petaluma stopped at the Wingspans for a lesson on raptor biology and identification, and they had excellent questions about the current conservation status of raptor species, especially Peregrine Falcons. The students marveled at an extremely cooperative young Cooper's Hawk as it made several low passes just overhead. Towards the tail end of the count, we watched as two juvenile Red-tailed Hawks, one of which was a dark morph, dive-bombed each other, grappling talons over Kremin's Crag. Eventually the hawks settled their differences and flew across the Golden Gate together.<br/>

<p>The Monday I team enjoyed an awesome day of hawkwatching with clear skies, plenty of sunshine, and some exciting raptor activity! When we first arrived at Hawk Hill this morning, we started counting the usual Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures that circle the hill. As the wind picked up speed and the number of birds in the sky increased, we started seeing a greater variety of raptor species. In the afternoon, the team got a great view of a juvenile Broad-winged Hawk that flew directly over the hill. The most exciting moment of the day occurred when the team noticed a small raptor with pointed wings zooming around in the North Quadrant. We quickly gathered together and determined that it was a Merlin! About an hour later, we were lucky enough to get a glimpse of another Merlin flying high towards the Golden Gate Bridge. Since these were the first Merlin sightings of the season, we were super excited to have a second look at the flight style and characteristics of these quick, little falcons.<br/>

<p>Today was a clear and sunny day up at Hawk Hill! We had a full day of counting raptors as the fog finally decided to stay away. The sunny skies brought visitors to our first Sunday hawk talk and we were delighted when an Osprey flew over for a close viewing. This was Sunday II team's first day on the hill after being fogged out two weeks ago. They were happily rewarded with this season's second Ferruginous Hawk sighting! With the fog finally clearing, we encourage future hawk watch teams to prepare for warmer weather, pack extra sunscreen, and get ready for an exciting peak!<br/>

<p>For the second week in a row, the fog was not forgiving to the Saturday II team. In the morning, we spent about an hour birding on Rodeo Beach. Although there weren't many bird species of note, we were lucky enough to see two porpoises playing in the waves. In the late morning, the fog had risen and it looked like there was potential for the summit of Hawk Hill to clear, but we had no such luck. As we got to the top of the hill around lunch time, the fog rolled in again, obscuring visibility and preventing us from doing a count. However, despite the suboptimal hawkwatching conditions, we still had several dedicated visitors who stuck around to watch the season's first Hawk Talk. As the talk was finishing, they were rewarded with a great view of two juvenile Red-tailed Hawks and a juvenile Cooper's Hawk, who came to the hill undeterred by the fog. Here's to hoping for better weather when peak rolls around in a couple weeks! <br/>

<p>The hawk watchers did not make it up to the hill today to do an official count as the fog was too thick. That didn't stop the Friday II team from getting outside and taking a walk around Rodeo Lagoon. While out, the team spotted an Osprey flying over with its wings in the classic "M" shape. We're looking forward to clearer skies in our upcoming September hawk watching days. <br/>

<p>Despite some initial fog high above the hill, the Thursday II team started the day with good visibility in the lower areas of each quadrant. By the late morning, our visibility improved further, and we had clear skies above with a decent amount of raptor activity. We got a nice long look at an adult Red-shouldered Hawk that circled above Kirby Cove, and later observed an Osprey flying near the Golden Gate Bridge. By mid-afternoon the fog crept back in, but just as we were preparing to end our count, a flurry of four American Kestrels emerged from the fog and sped directly over Hawk Hill. It was an exciting way to end the day, and our team looks forward to what the rest of the season has in store!<br/><br/><br/>

<p>Fog, fog, and more fog. Even though we're now into September, the August fog is still lingering. Unfortunately, the fog was too thick to make it up to the hill today, but the Wednesday II team still  made the best of the inopportune weather. We spent the morning birding around Rodeo Lagoon as we typically do on foggy days, and though visibility in the surrounding hills was poor, we still observed some neat birds. Our morning started off with a sighting of a juvenile Cooper's Hawk, which flew over Fort Cronkhite en route to Rodeo Beach, where it landed in the brush. Thanks to an excellent photo from a volunteer, we were able to see that the bird had a metal leg band, meaning it was probably banded recently at one of our blinds! We were also lucky enough to see a pair of Osprey surveying the water, although neither elected to dive into the lagoon in search of a late-morning snack. On our way back from the lagoon, we observed a small kettle of Red-tailed Hawks rising into the fog before disappearing from view. We also observed several interesting non-raptors, including recently fledged Common Yellowthroats, an Orange-Crowned Warbler, and a pair of vocalizing Virginia Rails which we were unable to find skulking in the marsh grass. Though we never made it up to the hill, we still had a great morning of birding and we're hoping for better luck next time around! Cheers from the Wednesday II team!<br/>

<p>Tuesday II's Fogwatch team spent the morning birding around Rodeo Lagoon waiting for the fog in the valley to lift. Armed with two scopes, we spotted a Killdeer and a Great Blue Heron foraging on the bank. Suddenly, a flash of brown wings drew our attention to a newcomer flying low over the lagoon. Luckily for us, this mystery bird perched on the fence line between the lagoon and the beach, and through the scope we saw its long, banded tail with a white terminal band and brown body - a juvenile Cooper's Hawk! We watched the young hawk until it took off into the brush and disappeared. Further along the lagoon, a flock of Red-necked Phalaropes was mingling with a trio of Pied-billed Grebes. Some notable mammalian sightings today included a Coyote crossing Bunker Road and two River Otters swimming among the reeds around the perimeter of the lagoon. Blues skies beckoned us up to Hawk Hill, but upon arriving, we discovered that the South and West Quadrants were still completely socked in with fog, so we did not start an official count. We've got our fingers crossed for better weather next time!<br/>

<p>The day started with clear skies and lots of enthusiasm from the Monday II team! We got up to the hill and were soon greeted by a juvenile Northern Harrier along with a few Turkey Vultures. Shortly after, we were also excited to see a dark morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawk glide past Hawk Hill and join a kettle of Red-tailed Hawks soaring above Kirby Cove. In the late morning, we got a nice look at the bright white crescents on the wings of a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk. With it being Labor Day weekend, we enjoyed the company of many interested park visitors on the hill today. We were able to help them spot raptors around us and answer their thoughtful questions. Unfortunately, the fog began quickly rolling in to surround the hill around noon and we lost almost all visibility in each quadrant. Right before packing up for the day, we had an American Kestrel break through the fog and fly directly overhead. Although we ended our raptor count early due to the thick and persistent fog, everyone was still grateful for the opportunity to hawkwatch today.<br/>

We got a few good hours of counting in before the fog rolled back over and surrounded us in the late afternoon. While visibility limited our bird sightings in the distance, some individuals decided to give us a closer look. These included a Cooper's Hawk, three American Kestrels, and many Red-tailed Hawks.

<p>While some fog in the morning started the Saturday 1 team with a walk around the lagoon, the sun won out and the team made it up to Hawk Hill for a full day of counting. The day turned out to be full of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures, as well as the occasional Cooper's Hawk zooming by. By mid afternoon the team was lucky to see some more rare species, with three American Kestrels flying in for a close view right over the top of the quadrants. A Broad-winged Hawk also made a visit quickly after the Kestrels; a full two weeks before our first expected sighting!

<p>It was another foggy day in the Marin Headlands. The Friday I team was hopeful for clear skies and waited patiently for the fog to move away but no such luck occurred. The team did make their way around Rodeo Lagoon where a juvenile Peregrine Falcon whizzed by at an incredible speed. The team also visited the Conzelman road roundabout where Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, and a Cooper's Hawk all made an appearance. The hawk watchers got a glimpse of the banders at poak blind catch a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk which was an exciting sight. As Fog-ust comes to a close in just one day, we're hopeful that September will bring us clearer skies with many more bird sightings!<br/>

<p>The sun was shining on Thursday I's team today! Partly cloudy skies and a breeze from the West made for good hawkwatching today on Hawk Hill. We started off the morning right with a flashy young Northern Harrier that worked its way around the hill, giving everyone a good look at its pumpkin-colored collar and flanks. A juvenile Cooper's Hawk also put on a show, circling in close above the hawkwatchers. Today was a great day for Red-tailed Hawks with 109 sightings, including #LH31L, who sports a lavender color band on its left leg. LH31L even joined us for lunch, as it was seen eating a snake in a dead snag on Hawk Hill!

Instead, we spent some extra time inside working on our raptor ID skills so that we feel more prepared for peak migration to start in just a few weeks. We then went for a walk around Rodeo Lagoon, and saw Red-necked Phalaropes, Marbled Godwits, Great Egrets, a Great Blue Heron, a Pied-billed Grebe, and a Common Yellowthroat. We were also pleased to see several Turkey Vultures circling in and out of the foggy sky above us.

<p>This is Fog Blog Episode IV: A New Hope. Glimpses of blue sky above Rodeo Lagoon gave us hope for the hawkwatch today, but sadly, the fog atop Hawk Hill was here to stay. We turned our binoculars to the trees around the Headlands Center for the Arts and the lagoon, spotting several Red-necked Phalaropes, Pied-billed Grebes, and one Ruddy Duck. A couple of Yellow Warblers flitted by, reminding us that, despite the dismal weather conditions, there are still migrants on the move. Our first raptor of the day was a young Cooper's Hawk seen atop a telephone pole near the GGRO Office. We enjoyed a lovely team picnic outside of the Marin Headlands Visitor Center, where we spotted a few Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures soaring low through the valley. We can't wait to get back up on Hawk Hill next time!<br/>

The Red-necked Phalaropes were still out in the eastern side of Rodeo Lagoon and were joined by some Pied-billed Grebes. While at the lagoon, the team got a wonderful surprise of hearing the calls of a Sora that was hiding deep in the reeds!

<p>The fog was heavy today but that didn't stop the Friday II team from having a great morning of bird-watching. Although the hawk watchers did not make it up to the hill for the count, plenty of raptors were seen flying over Rodeo Lagoon. This included some Turkey vultures and Red-tailed hawks that flew just within eyesight below the fog. The team also spotted some Red-necked phalaropes, Baird's sandpipers, and even river otters! The fog could not keep down this team's positive attitude for a successful hawk watching season. <br/>

<p>It was a strange day on Hawk Hill, at least with respect to the weather. In the morning, fog was swirling all around the base of the hill, obscuring our sight lines in three of the four quadrants. However, visibility above the fog line was nearly perfect, with unobscured views of Mt. Diablo, Mt. Tamalpais, and the Sutro Tower. Because of the low-hanging fog, we didn't officially begin our count until just before noon, when the fog cleared enough to provide clear raptor viewing in the North and East quadrants. In the early afternoon, we got great views of a juvenile Northern Harrier, which circled Hawk Hill for several minutes before heading south across the Golden Gate. Several small kettles of Red-tailed Hawks were also seen high above the Golden Gate Bridge. In the middle of our afternoon hawkwatching, fog began to creep up the hill and our counting was again confined to small portions of the North and East quadrants. But with about an hour left before we called it quits for the afternoon, the skies cleared in all but the South quadrant, and we picked up several new species for the day, including an American Kestrel, a Sharp-Shinned Hawk, and a White-Tailed Kite. Considering the constraints placed upon us by the weather, our final tallies of 76 raptors and 8 species were very solid for a relatively short day of hawkwatching. <br/>

<p>It was another beautiful day on Hawk Hill! Although a bit warm, there was a light breeze and clear skies as far as the eye could see. The day of hawkwatching had ebbs and flows, with some stretches lacking birds and others showing lots of activity. In the late morning, we were fortunate enough to see a juvenile Osprey, a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk sporting ivory crescents in its wings, and a few Northern Harriers, including a juvenile eating a vole on the wing. In the early afternoon, there was a lull characterized by low windspeeds and reduced bird movement. But in the last couple hours of the day, activity picked up significantly, with several excellent sightings just before day's end. These sightings included one more juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk, another Osprey, a female American Kestrel, a dark-morph Red-tailed Hawk, and a juvenile  Sharp-shinned Hawk being chased off the hill by a hummingbird. Our finally tally for the day was 8 total species, a very solid species diversity considering we're still in the middle of August. We can't wait to be out on the hill again in a couple weeks! Until then, all the best from the Wednesday II team! <br/>

<p>The day started out promising, with strong winds from the North blowing in handfuls of young Red-tailed Hawks and one Northern Harrier over the ridgelines. Turkey Vulture #368 made another guest appearance and circled the Hawkwatchers several times before disappearing into the approaching fog. The fog began to creep up around the hill around 1 pm, but the East and South Quadrants remained clear, so we continued our raptor count. Despite our stubbornness, the fog completely closed in around us within the hour, and visibility dropped dramatically. Because none of the quadrants could reliably see nor count any raptors, the call to return to the GGRO office was made shortly thereafter, so we packed up our scopes and headed down the hill for the day. <br/>

<p>Fog-ust is here in full force, and unfortunately the thick fog and low visibility on Hawk Hill prevented our raptor count today. We spent some extra time in the office this morning working on our raptor ID skills and discussing tricky field marks with the hope that the fog would lift in the meantime. We trekked up to Hawk Hill for a short visit to practice identifying the nearby landmarks and get familiar with the rhythm of our team. Unable to see even the resident ravens through the fog, we descended the hill and hiked along the Coastal Trail to look for birds and other wildlife. Luckily, the fog didn't put a damper on the group's energy, and we can't wait to return and put our landmark and ID skills to the test!<br/>

<p>Today was a beautiful day up at the hill! The morning started off foggy but cleared up and left us with blue skies and clear sights. Our hawk watchers were filled with excitement and enthusiasm when an adult Peregrine Falcon zipped by 3 times! We saw a total of 95 birds today which is a great way to end the first week of the 2019 season. <br/>

<p>Unfortunately, fog prevented the Saturday I team from counting raptors today. During the morning, we did a brief survey of the birds in Rodeo Lagoon. The highlights of our quick trip to the lagoon include  Snowy and Great Egrets, a Pied-Billed Grebe, a Great Blue Heron, a Willet, and a Caspian Tern. We did make the trek up to the top of Hawk Hill in the late morning, but by mid-afternoon the fog hadn't let up. There were a few Red-Tailed Hawks circling the hill that could be seen through the fog, but visibility was not good enough to conduct an official raptor survey. While we wish the weather could have been better today, we're also happy to hear how much success the teams earlier this week had! Hopefully in a couple weeks, we'll have a better chance to count some hawks! Until next time, cheers from the Saturday I team! <br/>

<p>It was a windy day up on the hill today! With winds gusting up to 25 miles per hour, we were definitely holding onto our hats while hawk watching today! However, despite the wind, visibility was great and there was still a fair amount of raptor movement. We saw a total of 126 birds today, representing 5 different species. While the vast majority of our birds were the usual suspects (i.e. Red-Tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, Northern Harriers, and Cooper's Hawks), we were lucky enough to have the season's first sighting of a Bald Eagle, a young juvenile that passed over the hill heading North. We've already seen 12 species so far this season, which is quite a few for the first week, so we're optimistic about what we'll see in the coming weeks! All the best from the Friday I team!<br/>

<p>Another beautiful day out on Hawk Hill! The strong winds from the West blew in some interesting birds throughout the afternoon. Between a flurry of young Red-Tailed Hawks and a few elusive Cooper's Hawks, we spotted an Osprey cruising across the North Quadrant. One of Hawk Hill's celebrity tagged Turkey Vultures, number 368, breezed by the Hawkwatchers up close and personal. The distressed calls from a juvenile Red-Tailed Hawk hinted us to our first sighting this season of an adult Golden Eagle, circling over the Golden Gate Bridge. The whole team was able to get eyes on this large raptor and marvel at how it dwarfed the nearby Red-Tailed Hawks. Within the same hour, another enormous bird soared into view and flashed its white tail and primaries, indicative of yet another Golden Eagle, this time a juvenile. By the end of the day our Hawkwatch team had doubled in size, and every in between cardinal direction was covered. Thanks to everyone who came out today!<br/>

<p>Today was a hot day on Hawk Hill! The birds must have thought so too since we had a pretty slow morning. Raptor activity picked up in the early afternoon as the ocean breeze swept in. Thanks to the clear skies all day long we were able to count raptors in all quadrants, especially the South and East. While we saw plenty of our usual guests around the hill, such as Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks, we also counted several Cooper's Hawks, a Sharp-shinned Hawk, and a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk. We were all taken by surprise when a brilliant adult Ferruginous Hawk appeared in our East Quadrant and soared above the north end of the Golden Gate Bridge for over 30 minutes! It is unusual to see an adult Ferruginous Hawk this early in the season, so it was an exciting surprise for our third day of hawkwatching!<br/>

<p>Another day of sunshine and mainly clear skies up on Hawk Hill! We started off the day right with two Osprey - the first of the season - spotted right as we began our count. A handful of Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks were spotted each hour, and one young Cooper's Hawk even treated us to a close flyover. We saw one juvenile Northern Harrier, one juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk, and two female American Kestrels (the first kestrels of the season!), but the real highlight of the afternoon was a White-tailed Kite! The migration is already off to a terrific start this year!<br/>

<p>Happy first day of the 2019 raptor migration season! We had a (mostly) clear day on Hawk Hill with plenty of sunshine, which allowed us to stay out and count birds all day. We started off the season counting many Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks, some Cooper's Hawks, a few Red-shouldered Hawks, and even a Northern Harrier! With the great enthusiasm of our volunteers and staff, we know that we have an awesome season ahead of us.<br/>

<p>Clear and sunny skies welcomed the Sunday 2 team for the final Hawkwatch day of the 2018 season! Throughout the day we enjoyed watching Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, and Cooper's Hawks fly around the Headlands. The team also got a good look at a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk as it flew around and perched in a distant tree  the first Red-shouldered to be spotted in a while! The day concluded with a Peregrine Falcon flying fast around the hill and into the sunset  a lovely end to a lovely day and season of Hawkwatching! Thank you to all the volunteers old and new who make our work at the GGRO possible, and we look forward to seeing everyone on Hawk Hill again in 2019! <br/>

<p>Today was a beautiful last day on Hawk Hill for Friday II. After so many days of smoke and rain, we felt lucky that the weather was in our favor. Although it was a bit of a slow day, we had some great looks at juvenile and adult Peregrine Falcons that flew close to the hill and impressed us with their graceful stooping. We had a lot of adult Red-tailed Hawk activity and heard a few fighting and calling at each other. Although the flight of raptors has decreased with the end of the migration season, we had a wonderful last day on the Hill. We're all looking forward to next year. <br/>

We got a great look at a pair of Turkey Vultures (one of which was our tagged friend #368!) sunning themselves on nearby rocks, and an exciting look at two adult Peregrines chasing an adult Red-tailed.

<p>Fighting falcons! The Monday II Hawkwatch team wrapped up the season with some amazing looks at adult Peregrines and male American Kestrels diving on one another around Hawk Hill. Despite the low number of Accipiters, the group enjoyed close views of Northern Harriers hunting and Red-tailed Hawks soaring. A midday Ferruginous Hawk flew directly by the Hill, showing off the trademark 3 points of light field mark  white on the upperside of both wings and at the base of the tail. Overall, a fantastic finish to an excellent season for the team!<br/>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving from Thursday I! Today was a gorgeous day on Hawk Hill and marked the first time Hawkwatch has been able to count in two weeks. Today's raptor activity was a bit slow and we ended early due to the holiday, but the hours we did spend Hawkwatching were very worthwhile. One of the best moments of the day was watching a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk stilling over the Hill get stooped on by an adult Peregrine Falcon. The Red-tail dodged the Peregrine, but it continued to chase the Red-tail with acrobatic and effortless dives and was joined by another adult Peregrine (presumably its mate). Needless to say, the young Red-tail disappeared quickly. It was quite the show! A last minute and far off Rough-legged Hawk crossing the Golden Gate and heading south finished off our special day. It is great to be back in the field, and we are looking forward to the last week of the season!<br/>

We hope the air continues to improve during these last two weeks, and for everyone to get up to the Hill for their last Hawkwatch day. Till next time, Wednesday 1 out.<br/>

<h2><a name='20181108'/>Thursday, November 08, 2018</h2>
<p>Thursday 1 was blown away by the great birds seen at Hawk Hill today! The day started off with many Red-tailed Hawks, Northern Harriers, and Turkey Vultures dancing around in the 35 mph wind. A couple adult Accipiters also flew around the hill, giving the team a great look at their gray and rufous plumage. Activity picked up later in the morning when three juvenile Ferruginous Hawks showed up, with one that circled lazily above us for a few minutes. Although no Northern Goshawks were seen today, an adult female Rough-legged Hawk was spotted in Kirby Cove who was close enough to Hawk Hill that we were able to admire here striking carpal patches, belly band, and dark banded tail. We had a brief look at a juvenile Golden Eagle and a light-morph Harlan's Hawk, which made enduring the high-winds worthwhile. Unfortunately, we had to leave the hill early due to poor air quality from the fires in Butte County.  Our thoughts are with the communities being impacted by the fires, and we hope everyone stays safe and healthy. <br/>

<h2><a name='20181107'/>Wednesday, November 07, 2018</h2>
<p>Today was a busy 13-species day with over 500 raptor sightings for the Wednesday 1 Hawkwatch team! The first bird spotted was an elusive gray ghost' (a male Northern Harrier) soaring above Slacker Ridge. An early male American Kestrel cruised around Hawk Hill, flashing blue-gray wings and dark malar stripes. Kettles of Red-tailed Hawks spiraled high into the sky, and flew over excited Hawkwatchers as they continued on to San Francisco. The day peaked when, around 1pm, the team witnessed an amazing array of six raptor species in under five minutes. First came two Sharp-shinned Hawks - one adult and one juvenile - catching thermals and rising up. Then we spotted two distant Red-shouldered Hawks, riding the wind along the coast. Suddenly, a sub-adult (~2 year-old) Bald Eagle popped up right in front of the team and winged its way north. Not a moment later, a Northern Goshawk rose up right under the sun and over our heads, joining a Cooper's Hawk and the Sharp-shinned Hawks in a rare kettle of all three Accipiter species! To top it all off, a dark-morph Red-tailed Hawk flew under the Accipiters and they all migrated south. The rest of the day did not disappoint, with good looks at White-tailed Kites, Peregrine Falcons, and a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk.<br/>

<h2><a name='20181106'/>Tuesday, November 06, 2018</h2>
<p>Today was a beautiful day on Hawk Hill. We had six dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks throughout the day, and a look at an interesting Ferruginous Hawk who sported an unusual rufous-tipped tail. The undisputed highlight of the day, however, was a group of agitated Ravens seen flying low in Kirby Cove. The source of their consternation was a low flying juvenile Northern Goshawk! It was great to see the Goshawk dwarf a Cooper's Hawk that flew by in the same field of view. This raptor was likely (though not definitively) the same individual which was spotted yesterday, considering how few have been seen in the Marin Headlands. The last Goshawk seen from Hawk Hill was in 2015, so this bird was a real treat for our Hawkwatch team and especially for our Hawkwatch Manager Step Wilson, who first spotted the bird, making it his first Goshawk seen from Hawk Hill. Congrats, Step! <br/>

<p>Today was a special day for the Monday I Hawkwatching team. The day started out with large kettles of Red-tailed Hawks with a few beautiful dark morph RTs. A few Red-shouldered Hawks joined the mix, flying around Hawk Hill and toward San Francisco. Accipiters were spotted in smaller numbers but still made an appearance around the Headlands. Then, in the afternoon, the team was ridiculously lucky to get a look at a juvenile Northern Goshawk as it steadily flew to land on a rock between the North and East quadrants! The excited team spent the final hour on the Hill enjoying the sunny day and occasional raptor in the last hour of Hawkwatching.<br/>

<p>A pretty slow day on the Hill for Sunday 2, but not a bad one! We were challenged periodically by distant kettles of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures. Occasionally, a Northern Harrier would join the kettles to spice things up.  We also got some close visits by Peregrine Falcons and a few Sharp-shinned Hawks, but saw surprisingly few Cooper's Hawks today (only 2!). A Humpback Whale also spent over an hour feeding in the Golden Gate within full sight of our Hawkwatch team, which was a real treat. (The other treat we got to enjoy today was our pizza, earned last Sunday 2 for seeing the first Rough-legged Hawk of the season!) <br/>

<p>Saturday II Hawkwatch had a warm, slow start to the day with little wind and less than 15 raptors spotted in the first hour. Nevertheless, the team persisted and the wind picked up, bringing raptors by Hawk Hill and toward San Francisco. Some of the first birds to appear were dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks scattered in with their light-morph counterparts and a potential light Harlan's Red-tailed Hawk, which joined the distant kettle. While the number of Red-tailed Hawk sightings remained high, we have been seeing fewer and fewer Accipiters over the past week. The day ended on a high note with the team riveted by the sight of an adult male Harrier mobbing two juvenile Red-tailed Hawks.<br/>

<p>Today had a very slow start, but raptor activity eventually picked up as the day progressed. As is typical for this time of year, our number of Accipiters has decreased steadily and has made for emptier skies. We did have some nice looks at Merlins today, including one that buzzed by Hawk Hill two minutes before we ended our count. Besides a few close birds, the majority of our sightings were high and distant, giving us an added challenge in the identification process. Luckily, with the help of spotting scopes, lots of eyes, and decades of experience among our volunteers, we were able to pick up some special raptors, including Friday II's first Ferruginous Hawk of the year! <br/>

<p>A warm and wonderful day for Thursday 2! Almost immediately after beginning the count, the team got a magnificent look at a juvenile dark-morph Rough-legged Hawk that flew directly over Hawk Hill. Shortly after, a pair of Peregrine Falcons rose up from the hills and circled the team as well. As the day went on and the temperature rose, some nice thermals began to form. Red-tailed Hawks, including some beautiful dark-morphs, Red-shouldered Hawks, and Turkey Vultures all took advantage of the heat and formed great kettles for the team to look at. It was also a great day for Northern Harriers, and there was one sighting of a juvenile and an adult male hanging out together low over the hills. Two of our tagged Turkey Vultures were also spotted sunning themselves on a nearby rock.  Overall, it was a great day for Hawkwatching!<br/>

<p>Wednesday II had a Spooktacular Halloween up on Hawk Hill. We were haunted by Gray Ghosts, and dark-morph raptors dominated the skies, including an adult Rough-legged Hawk, a few Red-tailed Hawks and even a Swainson's Hawk. A brilliant Red-shouldered Hawk cast its heavenly glow upon us before we descended back into the shadows of small Sharp-shinned Hawks and Turkey Vultures. Peregrine Falcons cackled eerily around us. While the raptors were clearly trying to TRICK us with their befuddling field marks, it was a real TREAT to watch these special birds. Happy Hawk-o-ween!<br/>

<p>Tuesday 2 is so happy to have had the chance for another full day of Hawkwatching, and an exciting one at that! A fabulous day with sightings of Peregrine Falcons swooping on Red-tailed Hawks and Northern Harriers. Two Rough-legged Hawks came into view this morning as well, one a juvenile and another an adult. Early in the afternoon our team also had the amazing luck of seeing 5 eagles - 2 Golden Eagles and 3 Bald Eagles! Even our Red-tailed Hawk sightings today felt special, with good views of some beautiful dark-morph birds and two others doing a display flight over Kirby Cove. In non-raptor news, we also watched about a hundred Brant geese fly by the Hill today, in addition to the usual massive flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons that circle the Hill often these days. All things considered, a phenomenal day for Tuesday 2 Hawkwatch!<br/>

<p>Despite clear skies and lots of sun, the day started slowly at Hawkwatch today. In the first couple hours of counting, we saw mostly Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks but were excited when a few Red-shouldered Hawks appeared around the Hill. Midday, the wind picked up slightly and the team got good looks at a variety of Northern Harriers including an adult male, an adult female, and a juvenile hunting in the hills of the Headlands below Hawkwatch. An early afternoon Ferruginous Hawk made an appearance, spiraling upward in front of the Golden Gate Bridge before heading south toward San Francisco. Not an hour later, a second FEHA was spotted in the west, over 2 miles away! The final (falcon) hour included visits from a speeding Merlin, a fluttering male and female Kestrel, and a zooming Peregrine falcon  a fast and furious end to a slow-starting day.<br/>

<p>For the first time in over a month, Hawkwatch was completely fogged out! Due to the surprisingly late season fog, the morning was spent birding around the lagoon where the team saw some Yellowthroats, American Wigeons, a Hermit Thrush, and a Merlin. A group of river otters was also spotted hanging out in the water! Conditions seemed to be improving around mid-morning, but the fog kept coming and refused to leave the headlands. As the team left, a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk came through the fog wall and flew close overhead as if to say goodbye. We hope that this is the last foggy day of the season, and look forward to some actual hawk counting next time!<br/>

Even with the little wind we had, we got 10 species of birds. A Peregrine Falcon hung near the hill, allowing us a couple of good looks. We also saw several Merlins and some nice dark morph Red-tailed Hawks. An overall great day with some great sightings. <br/>

<p>Friday 1 Hawkwatch had a great time up on the Hill. Our day started off foggy but cleared early on and allowed for a full day of counting. One of our most unusual sightings was a flock of 30 Canada Geese that flew high overhead in a classic arrow formation. Today was a great day for Northern Harriers; we spotted juveniles and adult males in every hour of the day, with some coming close enough to admire their facial disks and the shocking gray plumage of the adult males, colloquially called Gray Ghosts. We also had two beautiful White-tailed Kites fly by, slow enough for us to marvel at their bright white, unique plumage. One of the juvenile Red-tailed Hawks that was color-banded through the GGRO banding program stilled for a few minutes in front of the hill, making it possible to take a picture and read the number off the band. We are looking forward to finding out the day the bird was banded!<br/>

<p>Thursday 1's Hawkwatch day started out foggy, but quickly cleared up making way for a beautiful day for counting. We had great sightings of two Osprey, Red-shouldered Hawks, and some Peregrine Falcons and Merlins. A few of our team members debated the possibility of identifying one Merlin as a Prairie Merlin (Falco columbarius richardsonii), a subspecies of Merlin that breeds in the prairies of Saskatchewan and Montana. This particular bird looked light in color and had strikingly thick, light tail bands, which is characteristic of the subspecies.  We saw quite a few Accipiters and a good number of them were adults. A great day at the hill, and we are hoping to have fair weather again next time. <br/>

<p>Wednesday I had gorgeous weather and 11 species of birds! Adult and juvenile Accipiters alike flew closely over the Hill, giving the team a great opportunity to appreciate differences in plumage. An Osprey popped up directly under the noses of the Hawkwatchers in the western quadrant close enough that we could see the white scalloping on the back feathers, indicating that it was a juvenile bird. Towards the end of the day we had a large influx of Merlins, which skyrocketed past the in groups of 2 and 3. A great day of Hawkwatching, and we are excited for more to come on Hawk Hill!<br/>

<p>Today was Tuesday II's second full day on the Hill, and we enjoyed it! Overall, there was not a huge flight of birds, but activity picked up in the afternoon and we had a nice diversity of species. A White-tailed Kite flew directly over Hawk Hill, allowing all of us to admire it. Early on in our day, an adult Peregrine Falcon rose up from the hills below, close enough to see individual feathers and startle some of our Hawkwatchers. In the afternoon, we were distracted by a far-off Ferruginous Hawk when a kettle of Red-tailed Hawks seemingly appeared out of nowhere on the other side of the Hill. Our day was completed by an afternoon Merlin hunting a butterfly. After three unsuccessful attempts, the Merlin flew off and the butterfly carried on. We're wishing both individuals a successful migration moving forward. Tuesday II is hoping for more clear days on Hawk Hill! <br/>

<p>Band-tailed pigeons dominated the sky at Hawkwatch today  total sightings nearly doubling the number of raptors counted by the team! The morning started with a few birds flying around, including an early Peregrine Falcon. Things picked up in the afternoon with sunny weather and close looks at Red-tailed Hawks hunting, Accipiters flying toward San Francisco, and Turkey Vultures teetering around Hawk Hill. A White-tailed Kite flew directly overhead mid-afternoon, turning Hawkwatcher heads upwards. The day ended with a last-minute Merlin zooming by, crossing the Golden Gate Bridge and heading away.<br/>

<p>Though the day started off slow underneath grey overcast skies, Sunday 2 ended up with a wonderful day with some very exciting sightings. The morning began with many Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, and Cooper's Hawks flying far off in the distance. As the day went on and the Headlands warmed up, more birds started flying closer overhead, including American Kestrels, Merlins, and a beautiful juvenile dark morph Red-tail. Later in the afternoon, the first Rough-legged Hawk of the season made an appearance flying low and close near Hawk Hill! The team got a great look at it before it flew off through the Headlands and towards the south. The day wrapped up with a fun look at an adult Red-tail perched on a rock just a couple yards away from Hawk Hill eating some freshly caught prey before it was chased off by some of the local ravens. Overall, it was a great day for Sunday 2 and we're excited to have seen the first Roughie of the 2018 season! <br/>

<p>Weather on the Hill was uncooperative and fickle today - a thin but obscuring layer of fog came in and out of the Headlands all day, making spotting and passing raptors very difficult. However, in a briefly clear window near noon, our team managed to spot plenty of Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, and both adult and juvenile Accipiters. A couple of Harriers and small Falcons also flew over in that same timeframe. Shortly thereafter, sadly, the wind picked back up and the fog surged back over the Hill closing our count down early. Though today wasn't nearly as busy as the last Saturday II, we are hopeful for more good days down the road! <br/>

<p>Today the raptor flight around Hawk Hill was a bit slow; the sun beat down on us the entire day and there was little wind to be found. We got a great look at a White-tailed Kite that crossed the hills directly below us. A few juvenile Northern Harriers hung around most of the day, granting us the chance to watch their acrobatic flight behavior and see their unique plumage up close. Earlier in the day there was a nice stream of adult Accipiters, which trailed off as the afternoon progressed. Even in the hot sun, our small team carried on with great spirits. We are hoping for a Rough-legged in the coming weeks!<br/>

There were also some gorgeous adult dark-morph Red-tail Hawks soaring in a kettle with a Broad-winged Hawk. More kettles throughout the day appeared near Slacker Ridge, giving us a great opportunity to test our ID skills.

<p>Today was a beautiful and sunny day on Hawk Hill and raptors were abound! We are having a steadier stream of adult Accipiters and got some close looks at some very blue-backed male Sharp-shinned Hawks. Another highlight of the day was a juvenile Bald Eagle who flew in from the north and crossed the Bay in front of us. We got a long enough look to watch its flight pattern, a real treat for our team. Ten minutes before the end of our count, an Osprey rose up over the water at Kirby Cove, the perfect way to end the day! <br/>

<p>A slow start this Tuesday, but fortunately a full day of Hawkwatching (the first for Tuesday 2!). Clear skies greeted the team as we made our way up the Hill, but a layer of fog soon threatened to roll in off the ocean. Fortunately, shifting winds kept the fog largely away from us, giving us a chance to look at a good number of raptors. The star bird of the day was an incredible light-colored Harlan's Hawk that spent several minutes right above the heads of the Hawkwatchers! Other highlights included several adult Accipiters, close-flying American Kestrels, and all three subspecies of Merlin. All told, a very rewarding first day on the Hill for Tuesday 2! <br/>

<p>Clear skies and a cool breeze made for an excellent Hawkwatching day! The morning started off with some good views of adult Accipiters as well as Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, and a fast-moving Merlin. Things picked up midday when we spotted three White-tailed Kites as well as a sub-adult Bald Eagle flying just south of the hill (special thanks to an observant visitor for pointing it out!). We were also treated to a delightful view of an adult Red-shouldered Hawk circling the hills. Later in the afternoon the team got an excellent look at two juvenile Ferruginous Hawks cruising lazily around the Headlands. Overall, it was another great day for Sunday 1! <br/>

<p>Golden Hour came early on Hawk Hill today; between 1 and 2 pm we had four Golden Eagles, and a fourth year Bald Eagle! Today was a great day for Friday I, with sunny and clear skies that were filled with raptors. An adult Ferruginous Hawk flew low in front of the Golden Gate Bridge, giving us the chance to marvel at its rufous markings on its back and white underside. We also had a close sighting of a beautiful Peregrine Falcon hunting in the hills in front of us. The Peregrine sported a light gray back and a sandy brown tail and nearly resembled a Prairie Falcon. Considering these field marks, the bird was likely a juvenile Arctic Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus tundrius), a subspecies that nests in the tundra of Alaska and Northern Canada. We were lucky to have some cool non-raptorial species visit us on the hill as well, including a Rock Wren, hundreds of Violet-green Swallows, some Vaux's and White-throated Swifts, and two humpback whales out in ocean. We left the hill feeling very lucky, and a little sun-burnt from such a beautiful day!  <br/>

The morning started off with an excellent look at a juvenile Broad-winged Hawk flying around next to an American Crow. Soon after, we started seeing Red-shouldered Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, American Kestrels, Cooper's Hawks, and Sharp-shinned Hawks soaring around the hill. The team got a good look at an adult Peregrine Falcon soaring overhead as well. As the weather got warmer, we had high kettles directly above Hawk Hill filled with a variety of different raptors, including a juvenile Swainson's Hawk! The day concluded with a close-up look at a Merlin as it circled the team before flying off to chase down some prey. Overall, it was a wonderful day for Thursday 1!<br/>

<p>Falcon fight! Lots of good looks at falcons today, including a Kestrel and Merlin dueling early in the morning and two Peregrines in aerial combat later in the afternoon. Our personal favorite was a Merlin that dove repeatedly after a Raven right over the heads of our Hawkwatchers - so close that we could hear it! We also had a late morning sighting of a vagrant Palm Warbler, which continued to make appearances around Hawk Hill throughout the rest of the day. An excellent day for birdwatching stories.<br/>

<p>A disappointing day for Tuesday I; we were foiled again by our nemesis, The Fog. We were able to count for an hour before suspending our count and ultimately leaving the Hill early. On the bright side, we were able to get great looks at the field marks on the 20 birds we counted because they were so close to the Hill! (Any other farther-flying birds were invisible to us.) However, the wind and fog were worth enduring as we were joined by the GGRO's wonderful director, Allen Fish, who also happened to be celebrating his birthday today. Happy birthday, Allen!

We also had some close-up views of a pair of adult Peregrines flying right over the team. The team also got an excellent view of a juvenile Swainson's Hawk flying right off the side of the hill, bringing our total count for Swainson's up to 3 for the season! We ended our day with a great view of an adult Golden Eagle  an excellent end to an excellent day of Hawkwatching! <br/>

<p>The Blue Angels weren't the only ones putting on a show today! Beautiful clear skies and a nice breeze made for great Hawkwatching conditions, and the team had a fun challenge when multiple kettles of hawks started popping up in all directions. Groups of Cooper's Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, Red-shouldered Hawks, and Broad-winged Hawks circled high above Hawk Hill, taking advantage of the thermals forming from the warm weather. Turkey Vultures, including our tagged friend #368, also took advantage of the heat and soared around the Headlands. We also saw plenty of falcons  Kestrels, Merlins, and Peregrines were all spotted flying quickly overhead. The team also got great looks at some White-tailed Kites and Northern Harriers. Overall, Saturday II had an awesome day with the highest count of the season so far!<br/>

<p>Today was finally a beautiful day on the hill for Friday II! It was our first time getting an entire day out there, and our team was thrilled. We had a lot of close looks at a lot of great species, including a Broad-winged Hawk circling right above the hill and accompanied by an Osprey. A Merlin flew by close above us just minutes after we got up on the hill, and later in the afternoon an adult Red-tailed Hawk cried out its classic alarm call before stooping dramatically into Kirby Cove at an unseen threat. The raptors were not the only ones with impressive flight displays today, as the skies were also peppered with jets throughout the day who were practicing for this weekend's air shows, including the Blue Angels. <br/>A special thanks to the group of awesome volunteers who came out today to bulk up our team, considering it was especially small today! We appreciated the extra help and are very grateful. <br/><br/>

<p>Morning fog almost stopped the Thursday 2 team, but we persisted and were rewarded with some lovely, broad views of the Marin Headlands and the city later in the day! Though we started off slow, we had great clear looks at Red-tailed Hawks, American Kestrels, Cooper's Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, Northern Harriers, and Red-shouldered Hawks. In addition to the regular raptors, we had a great view of the Blue Angels practice flight from our vantage point at the top of Hawk Hill!

<p>Wednesday started out slow, with fewer than 5 raptor sightings in the team's first hour of Hawkwatching. However, a westerly wind picked up in the late morning and the raptors began appearing around Hawk Hill. Highlights of the day included an adult Red-shouldered Hawk diving on a juvenile Northern Harrier, a pair of adult Peregrine Falcons hunting on the Slacker Ridge, and a male American Kestrel flying directly over the Hawkwatching team. An exciting 10-species day for the team! <br/>

<p>The rain made the  Tuesday 2 team worried that we wouldn't make it up to the hill today, but the clouds broke and we made our way up. It was humid with little wind, and not a lot of hawks. We still were able to see a Grey Ghost, a sub-adult Bald Eagle and an adult Peregrine! Towards the end the wind picked up and the raptors started to stream by. Happy to finally get out for longer than 2 hours. We hope the weather will continue to improve for our team and that we will have a full day next time. <br/>

<p>Undeterred by stormy forecasts, the Monday II team headed up to Hawk Hill for their second counting day of the season. The group was greeted by sunlight and visitors from the Mendocino Coast Audubon Society. A male Northern Harrier (grey ghost) was the first raptor to appear, soon followed by a steady stream of Accipiters and Red-tailed Hawks that continued throughout the day. Mid-morning, the team observed a couple Broad-winged Hawks kettling with other Buteos and Turkey Vultures in the distance. Shortly after that, a far Ferruginous Hawk sighting and a nearly vertical stoop from a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk drew excitement from the assembled Hawkwatchers. The day concluded with two Merlins in the sky (one nearly over the Hawkwatcher platform on Hawk Hill) and a total of 12 observed species.<br/>

<p>Today's Hawkwatch wasn't particularly busy, but featured a nice diversity of species seen from the Hill. Highlights included several adult male Northern Harriers, a far-off Bald-Eagle, and a very nice up-close view of a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk that flew right over the team! Several other hawks, especially Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks, were flying high overhead today (and were at one point joined by a high-up Peregrine Falcon). While today's weather was pleasant for the Hawkwatch team, we are hoping for more hawk-friendly winds in days to come! <br/>

<p>Grey clouds hung low over the headlands this morning, but that did not deter Saturday 1 from getting up on the hill. Thankfully, the weather stayed mild throughout the day, allowing us to get good looks at American Kestrels, Red-tailed Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, and Cooper's Hawks. Early on in the day we also had some close looks at a pair of adult Peregrines and a White-tailed Kite hanging around the hill. Distant Red-shouldered Hawks and Broad-winged Hawks also made an appearance. The day ended with a couple of harriers including some beautiful adult males and an Osprey. We also had some non-raptor highlights today. A Band-tail Pigeon hung out on the railing during our noon Hawk Talk and a lovely proposal happened with a gorgeous view of the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. Congratulations to the happy couple from the Saturday 1 Hawkwatch Team!<br/>

<p>While it was a somewhat overcast day, we were able to have a full day of Hawkwatch and see a nice variety of species. Some of our highlights were a sub-adult Bald Eagle, multiple Broad-winged Hawks, and quite a few Merlins. This year, we have begun a new side project in partnership with Golden Gate Cetacean Research. Although we only record data when we observe whales in and around the San Francisco Bay, today we got a great look at a Steller Sea Lion enjoying a fish while being mobbed by gulls. It was great to see such a large marine mammal swimming below the raptors at Hawk Hill! <br/>

<p>Unfortunately, the fog was thick in the headlands today and prevented Thursday 1 from getting any Hawkwatching in. Though there were brief glimpses at some Accipiters darting in and out of the fog, the clouds were unforgiving and we quickly lost visibility. However, the team was able to join one of our outreach education group for a raptor release, where we got to see a female Sharp-shinned Hawk get released and disappear into the fog. <br/>

Aside from the Broad-winged Hawks, the group got good looks at Red-shouldered Hawks, dark morph Red-tailed Hawks, male American Kestrels, and a few Northern Harriers, including a Grey Ghost.

<p>Our count started late today, but a kettle of hawks (including several Broad-winged Hawks!) greeted us as we got to the top of the Hill. At the time, with good winds and lifting fog, all seemed like a promising day for migration. Sadly, less than an hour later, our familiar companion, The Fog, returned to the Headlands and swallowed our chances of seeing any more birds. With visibility worsening by the minute, we officially suspended our count early, and are hoping for better Tuesday 1's (and other days) in the future. (A quick disclaimer  though we had a great 40 minutes counting hawks today, the short timing of our count means that our reported Raptors per Hour for the day is quite high)<br/>

<p>The Monday I group enjoyed a morning of fog inversion (fog hanging low, sun on top of Hawk Hill) to start the fourth cycle of Hawkwatch! A bunch of Broad-winged Hawks, including a few late afternoon adults, were early visitors to Hawk Hill. The Broad-wings were often joined by Red-shouldered Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, and Northern Harriers, forming large kettles in front of the Golden Gate Bridge and Slacker Ridge. In addition to Buteos, the Hawkwatchers were frequently following falcons  American Kestrels, Merlins, and a mid-morning Peregrine to be exact. The migrating Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks continued to make appearances throughout the day (including an adult or two). Turkey Vultures and an Osprey capped the species count at 11. What started as a beautiful, sunny day ended at 3pm when the fog rolled back in.<br/>

<p>A very busy day at Hawk Hill today! Though we didn't have high hopes this morning looking at all of the fog, conditions improved throughout the day and we wound up recording our greatest number of raptors yet this season (with an average of over 115 raptors per hour!). In addition to the many Accipiters we saw in flight today we were fortunate to see many Broad-winged Hawks from the Hill, including some adults, as well as a good number of Merlins and our first Bald Eagle of the season! Hoping that the skies stay clear for future Hawkwatch teams. <br/>

During our hike around the lagoon and nearby trails, we saw 7 species of raptors. Osprey, Northern Harriers, American Kestrels, and Turkey Vultures all made appearances. We also saw Red-tails and Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks hunting in the fields. Hopefully the fog lifts soon and the team can get back to proper hawk counting next time!<br/>

<p>The first hour and 25 minutes of our day were beautiful; a strong northwest wind was blowing, the sun was shining, and Accipiters were flying left and right. Fog loomed over the ocean, but we continued counting raptors and watching Sharp-shinned Hawks dart about in the wind until it suddenly swept over the entire hill and left us with no visibility. We packed up our spotting scopes and binoculars and retreated down to Conzelman Road to attempt to wait out the fog, and yet it did not lift. Although we had to leave the hill early, we were able to get in one productive hour. Hopefully the gloomy weather will clear for tomorrow's team!<br/>

<p>Wednesday 2 was a busy day for hawk counting! The morning started with a slew of sharpie sightings  which continued throughout the day  as well as our usual Red-tails, Turkey Vultures, Northern Harriers and many Osprey. The species count began to climb late in the morning as Red-shouldered Hawks, American Kestrels, Broad-winged Hawks, and Merlins appeared around Hawk Hill. Mid-afternoon, a adult Ferruginous Hawk appeared amongst a group of Red-tails before flying towards the Golden Gate Bridge. A late in the day Golden Eagle made a quick appearance before disappearing behind the hill, unseen thereafter. A wonderful, sunny 14-species day!<br/>

<p>Started out as a foggy day, but the morning was filled with sightings of sea lions being released, porpoises, whales and a look at a rare Eastern Yellow Wagtail. The fog started to lift and Tuesday 2 was finally able to make it up to Hawk Hill where we were able to see an adult Red-shouldered Hawk. While we weren't up for very long today, we have high hopes that we have reached our fog quota for the season and will be expecting many clear days ahead. <br/>

<p>The Monday II team was greeted by a wall of fog upon arrival in the Headlands. Not to be deterred, the group set out to bird along the Miwok and Bobcat Trails and was rewarded with looks at 2 sleepy Great-horned Owls, a female American Kestrel mid-hunt, and an adult Red-tailed Hawk, which was promptly harassed by a male American Kestrel. Before leaving, the Hawkwatch team encountered a crowd of enthusiastic birders by Rodeo Lagoon. These birders pointed out the exact location of an Eastern Yellow Wagtail, which appeared in the distance a few minutes after the team arrived.<br/><br/>E-bird report of Eastern Yellow Wagtail (by William Legge): https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S48573259<br/><br/>

<h2><a name='20180916'/>Sunday, September 16, 2018</h2>
<p>After getting fogged out the past two Sunday 1's, we broke the record for the season so far with over 500 raptors! Though at times it seemed as if the fog would win, we had mostly clear skies throughout the day and were able to spot Red-tailed Hawks, Red-shouldered Hawks, and lots of Accipiters. Our patience with the fog was rewarded with two late afternoon Ferruginous Hawks, with one coming especially close to the Hill. The day wrapped up with some adult Red-tails hunting directly over us, making us feel less like the Hawkwatchers and more like the Hawkwatch-ees! It was great to finally get up on the Hill with Sunday 1 for the best day yet of the season. <br/>

<p>Fog drifted in and out of the Headlands today, making for some frustratingly short views of raptors. The team was still able to get some good looks at Red-tailed, Sharp-shinned, and Cooper's Hawks, with some flying right over the hill in front of us. There was also a great sighting of a Merlin that flew low overhead before disappearing into the clouds. Later in the day, we had a clear view of some Broad-winged Hawks and an Osprey over the water. A Humpback Whale was also seen from the hill, and the team had fun watching it smack the water with its fluke before diving down and swimming away. <br/>

<p>Although there was a fair amount of fog around Hawk Hill today, our team was able to count for a few hours, and we saw plenty of Accipiters! We saw more Sharp-shinned Hawks than Cooper's Hawks today. We also were delighted to see a couple Northern Harriers rise through the fog. As we left the hill, a juvenile Sharp-shinned flew low over all our heads and gave us a great look at it, almost as if it were saying goodbye. Until next time, sweet sharpies!<br/>

<p>Thursday 1 had a great time comparing Accipiters throughout the day. There was a steady stream of both Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks, allowing the team to compare and contrast the two and hone our ID skills. Other fun sightings included Broad-wingeds, Red-shouldereds, and a juvenile White-tailed Kite and a Ferruginous Hawk! We also were able to see a juvenile Peregrine Falcon hunting in the hills. Overall, a *golden* (like the juvenile eagle we saw!) day for Thursday 1!<br/>

In addition, the group enjoyed good looks at migrating Cooper's Hawk and Sharp-shinned Hawks as well as a solo Broad-winged Hawk, which flew directly over the viewing platform on Hawk Hill.

We got a great look at a juvenile Swainson's Hawk today, as well as a couple distant Broad-winged Hawks and a good number of American Kestrels. Our team also got lots of practice differentiating between Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks today, too. Looking forward to putting our new knowledge to use very soon!<br/>

<h2><a name='20180910'/>Monday, September 10, 2018</h2>
<p>Starting the third (sunny) cycle of Hawkwatch, Monday I team had an exciting 15-species day on Hawk Hill! The count began with many of our often-seen species like Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures. However, as the day continued, we began to see more diversity and greater numbers. Sharp-shinned Hawks and Cooper's Hawks rode along the Slacker ridgeline from noon onwards. A sub-adult Golden Eagle flew around Hawk Hill toward San Francisco, giving the team time to look at feather molt and determine the age of the bird. Northern Harriers flew in rocking dihedrals down in the valleys around the counting platforms. By the end of the day, the team had also welcomed three new species to this seasons' count: a distant dark morph Swainson's Hawk, a fast-moving Merlin, and a soaring adult Ferruginous Hawk. <br/>

The rest of the day was just as rewarding, with good looks at White-tailed Kites, juvenile Red-shouldered Hawks, and our first Broad-winged Hawks of the season! There was even a Golden Eagle spotted far off in the distance. Though it slowed down later in the day, Sunday 2 is happy to be the first team to hit double digits for number of species! Looking forward to more days like this.  <br/>

<p>A beautiful day for Saturday 2, and the best for Hawkwatch in a while. The good weather brought out lots of hawks for us to see  in addition to the regular Red-tail Hawks and Cooper's Hawks, we got a look at a Northern Harrier, an Osprey, and three beautiful White-tailed Kites. We also were lucky enough to see a Red-shouldered Hawk at today's Raptor Release (which accompany the noon Hawk Talks every weekend in September and October!). We also got to witness the launching of System 001 with The Ocean Cleanup Project, passing under the bridge and past Hawk Hill on its way to start cleaning up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. All told, an enjoyable day in the sun (with a nice breeze at the end) for Saturday 2!<br/>

<p>Today was a brief but successful day for Friday 2! Before we ventured up to Hawk Hill we saw a pod of at least 10 bottlenose dolphins from Rodeo Beach, and spent some time watching non-raptorial birds at the lagoon.  Although we did not ever fully shake the fog, we had an hour on the hill with a lot of Red-tailed Hawk activity and even got a look at a White-tailed Kite before the fog blew back in and covered our views. Here's to hoping the fog will finally clear for our weekend teams! <br/>

<p>It was another foggy day, but we were able to watch a Sea Lion get released by the Marine Mammal Center on the beach near our office building! We then had a nice stroll around the lagoon. We saw Wilson's Warblers, American Goldfinches and some Anna's Hummingbirds. There were also a couple of juvenile Black-crowned Night-Herons and Great Blue Herons hanging out in a tree together, and the team had a fun time comparing and contrasting the two species. Despite not getting up to Hawk Hill, Thursday 2 still had a great time bird watching today!<br/>

However, the team still had a good time birding on the beach and around the lagoon, seeing Western Sandpipers, a Pectoral Sandpiper, Marbled Godwits, and Red-necked Phalaropes. We also saw some Wilson's Warblers, Pacific-slope Flycatchers, Rough-winged Swallows, and Golden-crowned Sparrows. The team also got a great look at a low flying tagged Turkey Vulture, #372! Overall, the team had a fun time hanging out and are hoping for clear skies for next Wednesday 2. <br/>

<p>For our second outing in a row, Tuesday 2 was thwarted by an excess of fog above Hawk Hill. Despite this continued adversity, we birded around the Headlands in the hope that the fog would later lift (sadly, it did not). We did see a few Townsend's Warblers to brighten our day, however, and got some looks at intermediate- and dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks as well. Hoping the fog comes to an end soon, since we want to see more raptors - as well as our shadows. <br/>

Two different tagged Turkey Vultures visited the hill multiple times today, so to future teams: bring your zoom lenses!

We did get to see a particularly beautiful Red-tailed Hawk show off its rufous breast while perched, and a Red-shouldered juvenile soared in front of us for enough time for us to get some practice following birds with scopes. Unfortunately, the fog did not clear, so we ended the day early. Hoping for better luck next time!<br/>

<p>Fog prevailed throughout the day, but Saturday 2 was still able to make it up to the hill for a few hours of hawkwatching. Through the clouds, we saw Red-tails hunting and interacting with one another, Turkey Vultures soaring over the valleys, and American Kestrels zooming fast overhead. Eventually, the poor visibility made us cut the day short, but the team still had a great time hanging out on the hill. Here's to hoping for fog-less days on future Saturday 2s!<br/><br/>

<p>Friday 1 was another success story; what started off as a foggy morning turned into good conditions for hawkwatching. We got up onto Hawk Hill by noon and spent the afternoon counting. Being a small team with a lot of experience plus two apprentices and an intern, we spent a lot of time talking about field marks, flight style and shapes of the birds that passed us on the hill. We got a good look at a far away Peregrine Juvenile interacting with a Red-tailed juvenile, which made for great discussion and comparison. Thanks to some keen eyes we spotted two Kestrels in the last half hour of the day, as well as a tagged Turkey Vulture, whose number we were unable to read. We're all looking forward to reconvening on the hill, as a small but mighty team! <br/>

<p>Despite the hazy, overcast skies, Thursday 2 had a great time out on Hawk Hill today! We saw many Red-tails hunting over the hills, allowing us to get some practice aging them. We also caught glimpses of American Kestrels, Cooper's Hawks, and an Osprey throughout the day. There was much excitement mid-day when a group of Turkey Vultures flew right over the hill and we noticed one had a wing-tag. Everyone scrambled to get a good look at it, and together we were able to read its number - #368! Another highlight of the day was when an adult Peregrine Falcon zoomed around the hill, allowing everyone to get a nice long look at it. Overall, it was a wonderful first day and we are hopeful for more days like today. <br/>

<p>Today served as a great first day on the hill for our Wednesday 2 team! The hill was clear this morning, so we all hustled into our cars to start hawkwatching as quickly as we could. The fog came in and out intermittently in the morning with few birds in the sky, but as the day went on it stayed clear for us and we started seeing some cool birds. Multiple groups of Rough-winged Swallows and Band-tailed Pigeons flew by the hill, and we saw harbor porpoises and a humpback whale spouting in front of the bridge. We saw five raptor species in total, with one juvenile Cooper's Hawk that showed up in the last five minutes of the day making the only Accipiter of the day. We're all looking forward to reconvening on the hill in September.<br/>

<p>A heavy fog enveloped Hawk Hill preventing Tuesday 2 team from going up to the hill. The team headed to the Annex where the fog lifted long enough to see a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk and a Northern Flicker. Despite today's fog, we hope for better luck the next time around. Hopefully the fog rises sooner for the rest of the week. <br/>

<p>The fog from the weekend continued to hang over Hawk Hill during Monday II's first Hawkwatch day. However, the group kept a positive attitude and was rewarded with looks at a few Red-necked Phalaropes, a couple Caspian Terns, quite a few Swallows (Cliff, Rough-winged, Barn, and maybe some Violet-Greens), as well as our first Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures of the season. Hopefully, next week will bring clearer weather and additional interesting birds to see!<br/>

<p>Sunday 1 had a slow start due to the considerable amount of fog over Hawk Hill. However, the group still had a good time birding around the nearby lagoon, seeing seabirds such as Brown Pelicans, Double-crested Cormorants, and Western Gulls. We also spotted some Blue-gray Gnatcatchers and a Cedar Waxwing in the nearby bushes! Later, we moved over to a mowed field and got some great views of foraging passerines such as House Finches, Western Bluebirds, White-crowned Sparrows, and Spotted Towhees. There was also a great moment where we saw an American Kestrel angrily dive at a Red-tailed Hawk that was hanging out in a tree. Despite the poor weather conditions that prevented us from getting up the hill, Sunday 1 still had a fun morning birding!<br/>

<p>We were on the hill for only a short time due to fog but saw 7 species including our first Prairie Falcon of the season! We also saw an Osprey and some American Kestrels. While the fog kept coming in and out, distorting our view, we were still able to practice identifying hawks, getting especially good at aging Red-tail Hawks. We are hopeful for a clearer day the next time out at Hawk Hill. <br/>

<p>A bright, sunny day, perfect weather for Friday 1 to go up to Hawk Hill. We got excited by the sighting of an Osprey flying overhead and got practice counting the numerous Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures in the area. There was an occasional Cooper's Hawk and American Kestrel to make 5 species seen on the hill. A successful day,  we look forward to our next time out.  <br/>

<p>Today marked the first day of Hawkwatch for Thursday 1. The morning started off well; minutes after we got settled in our quadrants an Osprey appeared straight overhead. We continued having a steady stream of sightings throughout the day, with a handful of juvenile Red-tailed Hawks every hour plus others. We even caught sight of a Turkey Vulture that was tagged for our Project Zopilote! The vulture appeared a few times right below us and even though the bright blue patagial tags are large with three printed numbers, we all struggled to get a good view of the number. However, passing the tagged vulture between quadrants was a great team-building experience for us and added some excitement to our pre-peak day!<br/><br/> We would definitely recommend other Hawkwatchers who have cameras with good zoom capability to bring them out, not only to take pictures of the beautiful migrants we see, but also to take pictures of tagged vultures. <br/><br/>

<p>Despite a foggy start to the week, today Hawkwatch kicked off the first official day of raptor counting for the 2018 fall migration season! We were lucky to have seen Peregrine Falcons, Northern Harrier and a small group of Purple Martins while on the Hill. Our team got a lot of practice identifying Red-tailed Hawks as many decided to hover overhead for long periods of time. An adult Accipiter flew overhead, helping to shake off the off-season rust of having to differentiate Cooper's Hawks from Sharp-shinned Hawks. In the end it was an adult Cooper's Hawk. A great first day on Hawk Hill, and an excited look to what the season will bring!<br/>

<p>We had a slow start for Tuesday 1, facing considerable fog this morning in Fort Cronkhite. Conditions around the office seemed to be improving around 11:30, so we took an optimistic drive up to the Annex. Unfortunately, the fog near the Hill did not clear, and we were forced to call the day early. However, the uncooperative weather did not keep our team from getting some good looks at juvenile Cooper's Hawks, a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk, and even an Osprey! We remain hopeful for sunnier Hawkwatch days in the future. <br/>

<p>Greetings readers!<br/>Here at GGRO, we're eager to announce the start of Hawkwatch 2018! This season, Hawkwatch is thrilled to have so many wonderful volunteers returning and proud to be joined by 28 new apprentices. <br/>Unfortunately, the season started with a fogged-out day. However, the Monday 1 team managed to make the best of it by taking a Raptor ID quiz and watching flight videos. These educational moments were designed to help train new Hawkwatchers as well as to refresh raptor identification to everyone in the program. The team put their skills to the test, identifying a Red-tailed Hawk and Turkey Vultures down by the Lagoon later in the morning.<br/>Overall, it's exciting to have everyone back for the fall migration. Best of luck to the rest of the teams this week!<br/>

<p>Howdy readers!<br/><br/>Today the Sunday 2 team enjoyed one final beautiful day on the Hill. Temperatures remained in the fifties all day with winds coming from the northeast and southeast. With a spread of all sorts of goodies from the hawkwatchers, our team was ready to count!<br/><br/>Most of our activity today came from Redtails, TVs, and Harriers. The occasional accipiter and falcon would pay us a visit, but the Redtails stole the show. One of them in particular kept us entertained throughout the daya juvenile Redtail that the GGRO banded back on September 14th! We could spot his unique color band as he perched in trees, on Fish Rock, and hovered suspiciously close to our snacks. At one point he flew so close over the north quadrant that the hawkwatchers ducked! <br/><br/>Overall, the Sunday 2 team felt extremely lucky for the great season we had and the amazing raptors we saw. <br/><br/>From all the interns here at the GGRO, we want to thank the volunteers for all the passion, effort, and enthusiasm that they bring to the Hill. It's been a pleasure to learn from our teams and take part in an amazing program that supports the preservation of the raptors we love so much. From sights routine as seeing a TV over Slacker Hill to exciting as watching a Ferrug soar effortlessly over the Headlands, every moment was a special one. Thank you for sharing them with us!<br/><br/>Hawkwatch out. <br/><br/>

<p>We can't believe it's already the second to last day of the season! Just like the raptors, time has flown by. Today was a hazy day with temperatures ranging from the low fifties to the low seventies and light wind coming from the north. It started as a sunny day but by the afternoon the clouds rolled in and the temperature dropped. <br/><br/>Raptor activity was overall low, but the day was punctuated with some exciting sights! A juvenile Bald Eagle was spotted in the south quadrant and made it's way around the Hill and through the west quadrant to rise above Mt. Tam! After an overall good eagle season, this sighting broke the tie between Bald and Golden Eagle sightings with Balds now leading 17-16. Go Balds! There was a lull in the day after the eagle until a male Kestrel was spotted. He flew close in front of the hawkwatchers in the west quadrant and gave them a great look of this falcon that has recently become a less common sight.<br/><br/>Saturday II has been a fun team full of laughs and smiles throughout the season. As interns, it has been a pleasure to be on this team! This is also our last day of hawkwatch of the season so we would like to thank all of the volunteers who we have worked with for their guidance, knowledge, and company. We will miss you all and hope to see you on the Hill in the future! <br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p>Hello hawk fanatics!<br/><br/>It was a sunny, but hazy day with temperatures hovering around 60 degrees Fahrenheit and winds from the southeast. The weather was on our side until the end of the day when there was a significant decrease in raptor activity around 1 PM. But early in the day there were raptors everywhere! <br/><br/>Quadrants were busy with high-flying Redtails and Sharpies and low-flying Harriers  even an adult male Harrier made an appearance! A few adult Peregrines were also seen harassing Redtails (as they do) and putting on a show. The team was delighted to see another falcon as an adult male Kestrel flew overhead sparking debates about which raptor species is the cutest (Kestrels, obviously). <br/><br/>Although the end of the day was slow in terms of raptors, the potluck fueled our hawkwatchers to continue on. As always, we had a great day with our Friday II team and would like to thank them for a wonderful season!<br/><br/>

<p>Hello raptor aficionados!<br/><br/>A wonderful end to a great team - PIZZA BIRD! On this gorgeous and clear fall day, we saw the first Rough-legged Hawk of the migration season, which calls for volunteers ordering pizza and enjoying the wondrous sight of the day. This brought our total to a respectable eleven species for a day this late in the migration! <br/><br/>The Roughie came from far out over the ocean around Rodeo Beach and into the north quadrant. It disguised itself as a Ferruginous Hawk, but when it hovered in front of the team, it showed its distinct carpal patches and cheers erupted from the Hill! After lingering for a couple of minutes, it made its way across the Golden Gate, but we hope it makes more appearances in the coming days so look out!<br/><br/>Besides the many Redtails and Turkey Vultures seen, other notable sightings include two White-tailed Kites, one juvenile Ferrug, and one adult female Northern Harrier. The smallest North American falcons were also seen from the Hill today. Overall, a very exciting and eventful day!<br/><br/>Thank you Thursday II team for a wonderful season! Hawkwatch on and out!<br/>

<p>Hello raptor people!<br/><br/>Today was a beautiful and clear day up on the Hill with temperatures in the fifties and low sixties. Winds mostly came from the east. With binoculars and snacks at the ready, the Wednesday 2 team was ready to count one last time this season.<br/><br/>Our most active hours were from 10am to 1pm with sightings mostly comprised of Redtails and TVs but with dash of accipiters. Some notable sightings include three Peregrines high in the sky battling it out with Redtails. Later in the day we spotted three dark morph adults and two juvenile Redtails. One of our adult sightings was a beautiful rufous morph. <br/><br/>We also had some fun non-raptor sightings, which included coyotes and one displaying Anna's Hummingbird. This tiny dancer would periodically rise up and then dramatically dive in hopes to either impress a lady or intimidate its opponents. Either way, we were impressed. Hats off to you little guy!<br/><br/>Overall, the Wednesday 2 team was grateful to finally have one gorgeous sunny day on the Hill. Thanks for the great season!<br/><br/>Hawkwatch out.  <br/><br/>

<p>That's a wrap for the Tuesday II team! On this beautiful, clear fall day, we finished with 348 raptor sightings - not a bad number during the last cycle. The temperatures were mostly in the mid-60s and the wind was barely there, nevertheless, raptor activity picked up after our second hour on the Hill.<br/><br/>Some very interesting raptors were seen from Hawk Hill today. A total of five Red-shouldered Hawks (one adult and four juveniles) flew around the team. One of the Redshoulders was seen being chased by a couple of ravens around Mt. Tam! Another highlight of the day was seeing a Prairie Falcon, making today a four falcon day! The rest of the sightings consisted of the typical suspects - lots of Redtails, Turkey Vultures, and accipiters.<br/><br/>Thank you Tuesday II team for a great season and the feast we enjoyed on the Hill today. With birds still on the horizon, let's hope for more good days as the season comes to a close.<br/>

<p>Monday II had a beautiful day on the Hill to start off the last week of the season! The temperatures stayed in the mid-sixties all day with minimal wind and high visibility. As expected towards the end of the season, there was low raptor activity but that didn't stop the Monday II team from finding all there was to be found!<br/><br/><br/>Our usual suspects of Redtails and Turkey Vultures dominated the skies but some of our most interesting and exciting sightings were not of the raptorial variety. In the south quadrant, a raft floating from the Golden Gate with a rag-tag crew of gulls was seen sailing out to sea. We aptly named the vessel the S.S. Bay Gull. Not to be outdone, the north quadrant spotted a beautiful coyote relaxing in a rock garden. All scopes were pointed at the coyote as we observed it sleeping, rolling around in the gravel, and being an all-around cutie. <br/><br/><br/>Thank you to our Monday II team for the snacks, laughs, and good times throughout the season! Hope the rest of the week brings clear skies and raptor flybys! <br/><br/><br/>

<p>Despite the overcast skies, today's visibility was one of the best the Saturday I team has seen this season. We could see over sixty miles into the north and the Farallon Islands were in view during the entire count. It was windy on the Hill - wind speeds reached over 14 mph - and many birds took advantage of the currents to take flight.<br/><br/>While surrounded by giant soap bubbles, our time on the Hill resulted in 274 raptor sightings - a great total for this late in the migration season! Turkey Vultures, Redtails, and accipiters dominated today's flight. Many Sharp-shinned Hawks circled above the Hill and gave us wonderful views of both their adult and juvenile plumages. A checkered, rufousy dark morph juvenile Redtail also flew very close to the team while showing off its chocolaty tones. Due to the end of the season festivities, lots of actual chocolate was eaten atop Hawk Hill today! Our volunteers enjoyed a nice flow of raptors and visitors while celebrating a great season and the wonderful company of fellow hawkwatchers!<br/><br/>Thank you Saturday I for the spectacular hawkwatching this season! Hawkwatch on!<br/><br/>

<p>With a cloudy and chilly start to the day we did not expect much raptor activity. However, temperatures rose to the mid-70s and the sun peaked through the clouds most of the afternoon, creating a nice glow on the city and the hills throughout the Headlands. On the other hand, this light also made it a bit difficult to distinguish plumage coloration on the accipiters seen from Hawk Hill. Nevertheless, we had an eventful day that resulted in over 300 raptor sightings of ten species.<br/><br/>The most exciting moments of the day were the multiple sightings of White-tailed Kites  this is the first time the Friday 1 team has seen this species from the Hill this season! The north quadrant had a period of heavy raptor activity early in the day. At one point, while looking towards Mt. Tam, a large kettle of eleven Turkey Vultures was spotted rising in the sky. Later on, an adult Red-shouldered Hawk was seen making its way across the Golden Gate, its red coloration standing out against the blue sky!<br/><br/>The Hill was not just full of birds today. Due to the Thanksgiving holiday, many visitors came to the Hill to enjoy some time off with their loved ones!  It was nice to see people taking advantage of the beautiful outdoors available to them on their day off. As we reach the end of the raptor migration season, we hope you join us (or consider joining us for the next season).<br/><br/>Hawkwatch on!<br/>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving hawk lovers!<br/><br/>On this lovely Thanksgiving Day it appeared that all the raptors were preoccupied and unavailable for counting. Our first bird of the day was a juvenile Harrier, which was appropriately nicknamed a lil' slice of pumpkin pie just like the one so kindly shared on the Hill by our hawkwatchers. Can't wait for more slices of pie later this afternoon! Strangely, on this Turkey Day we saw zero Turkey Vultures - the domesticated kind will have to do! <br/><br/>So our hawkwatchers could spend more time with their loved ones, we ended the count at 12:30. During these three hours we had a total of 11 raptor sightings. This is potentially a new record for least amount of birds seen while on the Hill. However, we are thankful for our wonderful volunteers and the magnificent raptors that migrate through the Headlands! <br/><br/>Happy Thanksgiving! Hawkwatch out (for dinner)!<br/>

<p>Greetings readers!<br/><br/>We celebrated our final Wednesday 1 Hawkwatch day of the season through a count fueled by muffins and other tasty goods! It was mostly cloudy throughout the day with temperatures in the low to mid-sixties. Winds were solidly out of the north and northeast and picked up in the afternoon. <br/><br/>Most of our notable raptor sightings occurred in the morning. We saw two Merlins and one adult Peregrine within thirty minutes of the count. The Coop reportedly visiting multiple Hawkwatch teams the past few weeks was seen perched on Fish Rock once again. Besides those sightings, the usual assemblage of Turkey Vultures, accipiters, and Redtails were present mainly in the morning as well. <br/><br/>To end our day, southwestern clouds made a beautiful sunset color display-a bittersweet ending for this awesome team. It was a pleasure counting with Wednesday 1! <br/><br/>Hawkwatch out. <br/><br/>

<p>The Tuesday I team enjoyed lovely sunny weather and temperatures in the sixties, perfect for the food and festivities that marked the end of the migration season. It was a fairly windy day with wind speeds between 10-15 mph. We were greeted by an adult Peregrine waiting for us at the top of the Hill. Throughout the rest of the day we were visited by many Sharpies and Redtails making their way around the Headlands. <br/><br/>After lunch an unusual bird was spotted rising up from Kirby Cove. Shouts rang out from the Hill and interns jumped with joy. We watched this vision of beauty proceed towards the blinds and could not believe our eyes. ON THIS GLORIOUS TUESDAY WE WITNESSED HISTORY AS OUR PHENOMENAL BANDERS CAUGHT A FERRUGINOUS HAWK! This is the third Ferruginous ever banded at GGRO  an adult no less - and we could not be more excited and in awe!<br/><br/>We cannot think of a better way for this team to end the season and are so thankful to share exciting moments like this with our wonderful volunteers!<br/><br/>Check out our Ferruginous Hawk by following the link below!<br/><br/>https://flic.kr/p/21Fsi5Y<br/><br/>

<p>Happy last cycle hawkwatchers! Sadly, it is the beginning of the end of the season but we are still searching the skies for the last migrating raptors. It was overall a slow day with cloudy skies and temperatures in the high fifties to the mid-sixties throughout the day. Winds were mild and out of the southwest and brought light rain in the middle of the day. The cloudy skies created mesmerizing light around the Hill with patches of sunlight peeking through.<br/><br/>We saw a lot of perched raptors today in every quadrant  mostly Redtails and one Kestrel. We think this may have been due to the weather. Of the flying raptors, we mostly saw Redtails, Turkey Vultures, and Harriers. The most interesting sighting of the day was a distant juvenile dark morph Redtail that was completely dark on its underside.<br/> <br/>Even with the low raptor activity, we enjoyed the company of the Monday I team during their last scheduled visit to the Hill of the season! We hope the skies stay dry in the days to come. Hawkwatch on!<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p>Howdy readers!<br/><br/>Today marked another day in paradise up on the Hill. Temperatures remained in the fifties throughout the day and we enjoyed a nice southerly breeze. Conditions were clear and the hawkwatchers were ready to count!<br/><br/>The first five hours were marked by a steady stream of raptor sightings. Our highest count was between 11am to 12pm when we had 123 sightings. Accipiters were zooming left and right through our views as shouts of Juv Sharpie coming your way! and Is that an adult Coop? filled the air. Additionally, kettles of Redtails appeared seemingly out of nowhere and flooded the sky. At one point the hawkwatchers observed two adult Peregrines taking turns diving on a trespassing Redtail. <br/><br/>Then, as one hawkwatcher put it, somebody turned off the raptor hose. Our southerly wind died around 2pm and our sightings dropped. In our last 30 minutes of the count we only had three juvenile Harrier sightings; however, our team reminisced about the start of the season when even seeing one Harrier was exciting and new! We did use our last hour for good, however, as Hawkwatch became Baywatch and called in a stranded paddle boarder who was later picked up by the Coast Guard. Our hawkwatchers don't only look out for raptors up on the Hill! <br/><br/>Some exciting non-raptor sightings included a deer spending a good amount of time eating lichen off of Fish Rock. Later a raven perched there and our desperate hawkwatchers spent five minutes discussing what exactly it was eating. In the last 30 minutes we watched as a distant coyote took a snooze in the sunlight. <br/><br/>Overall, the day was great and the company even better. Now we begin the last cycle of Hawkwatch for the season and remain excited for the sightings yet to come.<br/><br/>Hawkwatch out. <br/><br/>

<p>Another beautiful day up on the Hill! The visibility was to the Farallons and beyond with temperatures staying around 60 degrees Fahrenheit. We had a good amount of wind coming from the northeast for most of the day. Raptor activity was high throughout the day except for a big slow down during the last hour of counting when the sun receded behind some clouds and the wind died down.<br/><br/>Today was another eleven species day, so it was a great day to see some amazing raptors! We were even greeted in the parking lot by a Peregrine Falcon flying close-in. Even though that is a pretty good way to start the day, things got even better. In the first hour of counting we had already seen nine species, including a Bald Eagle and a Golden Eagle! Even though the Golden Eagle was distant, we got a really good look at the juvenile Bald Eagle that started above Hill 88 then made its way around south quadrant and continued its migration south. It stayed in view for a significant period of time, allowing all of the hawkwatchers to admire it. Similar to yesterday, Sharpies seemed to be flying the same line through the valley, rising above rifle range, flying close in front of the hawkwatchers in north quadrant, and continuing their journey south toward the Golden Gate Bridge. We also got some good looks at some blue-backed raptors  adult male Merlins and adult accipiters. We saw three falcon species again today and continued to have higher accipiter numbers than the previous few days.<br/><br/>Hope the raptor flights continue to be abundant and diverse! Keep your eyes to the sky, there are raptors to watch! Hawkwatch on. <br/><br/>

<p>What a beautiful day on the Hill! It's hard to believe that just yesterday it was rainy and foggy but clouds were a rarity in the sky today! It was so clear that buildings could be made out on the Farallon Islands. The winds were finally coming from the north and the temperatures hovered around 60 degrees Fahrenheit.  The winds seemed to push the raptors to the ocean, forcing them to make their way inland on a line from Rodeo Beach to north quadrant. West quadrant enjoyed a nice parade of juvenile Redtails and Sharpies during the afternoon! <br/><br/>Even though today was abundant in Redtail sightings, it did not lack in diversity. We ended the day having seen 11 species! We saw both types of eagles (although distant looks), a plethora of accipiters, and three types of falcons. The Redtails themselves had some diversity too! We spotted a very dark adult Redtail that flew close-in to the Hill, a tiger-striped tailed adult, and a dark speckle-bellied juvenile. Unfortunately, we didn't see any Roughlegs but it did cause us to pay closer attention to the Redtails we were seeing and appreciate their individuality as well as their beauty. Today also marked the return of the juvenile Cooper's Hawk that frequents Fish Rock and supports us. She visits Fish Rock so often that she is starting to feel like part of our team!<br/><br/>Hope everyone enjoys that sunny days before the rains return! Happy Hawkwatching!<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p>Rain, rain, rain  that is all we saw today!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the fog and drench levels kept us from the Hill and the general outdoors. Better forecast is on the horizon for the next couple of days, so let's hope we can get out and counting again; maybe we will finally see the much anticipated Rough-legged Hawk!<br/><br/>Cross your fingers and hope for clearer, drier skies.

<p>Greetings raptor enthusiasts!<br/><br/>It was a tad chilly and windy up on the Hill today. Although this proved to be a better outcome than expected, for we thought rain would keep us from counting. <br/><br/>Activity was rather low with a major drop off in numbers around 1pm. There was one raptor that helped us through the day and provided emotional support as we scanned helplessly for hawks. A juvenile Coop visited each quadrant as we tracked her perch to perch. This suspected lady sat on Fish Rock multiple times and gave us a good show. At one point the ravens chased her from her throne but she came back after a while (and after stooping on them a couple of times) and reigned supreme. <br/><br/>The Wednesday 2 team left the Hill dreaming of hot cocoa and warm baths but happy that the day proved better than expected. <br/><br/>Hawkwatch out.   <br/><br/>

<p>Howdy, readers! <br/><br/>One of the prettiest days on the Hill lately! Temperatures ranged from the mid-fifties to high-sixties with winds from the W, NE, and SW. Visibility was far-reaching, which was very helpful in tracking far-reaching raptors! <br/><br/>We saw some awesome raptors today! A few memorable sightings include, an adult Bald Eagle over the south platform, high in the sky; six Merlin sightings throughout the day; a Red-shouldered Hawk shooting down like an arrow into Kirby Cove; and one White-tailed Kite seen flying through east quadrant coasting north. As per usual, we saw the same slew of Redtails, but with a gorgeous rufous-morph sighting from north quadrant in the 11am to 12pm hour. Overall, we saw a total of 11 species!<br/><br/>The skies were clear, the raptors were beautiful (no surprise there!), and we were in good company. Safe to say we enjoyed our day on the Hill!<br/> <br/><br/>

<p>Hello hawkwatchers!<br/><br/>Though our day was cut short by the rains at 1:15 PM, we were able to observe some thoroughly entertaining bird behavior. We were greeted on the Hill by a young female Cooper's Hawk who flew right over our heads and landed on the railing past the south platform. This Coop hung around for quite some time and eventually migrated to Fish Rock where she perched and posed for the hawkwatchers to admire. At one point, this spunky bird attempted to steal a mouse from a passing raven! She made multiple stoops, but ultimately the raven kept his snack to himself. Trouble seemed to follow the Coop as a juvenile Harrier chased her around south quadrant. <br/><br/>After the shenanigans were over, we mostly saw Redtails and Turkey Vultures. We watched the clouds approach with unease and prepared ourselves for the possibility of rain. Once it started sprinkling, we headed down as we did not want to get caught in a downpour. <br/><br/>It would seem the rainy season is upon us. Stay dry out there folks! Hawkwatch out!<br/>

<p>Hi readers! <br/><br/>Today started off with clouds down at home base. As we arrived on the Hill, we were greeted with sunny, mostly clear skies. Temperatures were in the low to mid-sixties all day, with low highly variable winds. <br/><br/>Raptor activity was relatively steady throughout the day. Notable sightings include a total of six White-tailed Kite, two juvenile Bald Eagle, and one juvenile Ferruginous. One of the Bald Eagles flew in close by west quadrant and joined a Redtail circling out in the valley. Hawkwatchers were mesmerized by the size difference between these two raptors; the Eagle dwarfed our favorite buteo. We ran into a familiar Kestrel perched on the telephone poll by the Rifle Range as well. The Ferrug rose up in front of north quadrant and steadily made its way into the clouds. Three of our six White-tailed Kite sightings flew right over the Hill one after the other. Like ducks in a row! <br/><br/>What a beautiful, diverse raptor species day on the Hill! Thank you, Sunday 1 for a great day. <br/><br/>

<p>Today was a beautiful day up on the Hill! Light fog graced the Hill when we arrived but it quickly dispersed to reveal sunny, partly cloudy skies. The temperatures were in the mid-sixties to start and warmed to the mid-seventies towards the end of the day. There was very light wind that was mostly coming from the east.<br/><br/>There was a nice raptor flight today dominated by Redtails and Turkey Vultures. We also saw quite a few Northern Harriers! A couple of unusual species were spotted today, including White-tailed Kites and American Kestrels. These small falcons have been regularly seen perching on the telephone pole next to the building on the rifle range and on the telephone wires! Some of the Kestrels seen today were hover-hunting on the hillsides without much success but providing a great view of this common behavior for this species.<br/><br/>Today was a total turnaround from yesterday and hopefully there are more days like today to come!  Hawkwatch on!<br/>

<p>What a strange day on Hawk Hill! Although we arrived at the same time as usual, after about thirty minutes we were driven off the Hill to seek shelter from the sudden rain. During our short time of counting, we spotted a total of eighteen raptors and we hoped to start the count again and spot some more. While waiting out the rain, the fog rolled in, taking away the possibility of any counting for the day.<br/><br/>Friday 1 team did not give us so easily though! We hoped the rain and the fog would pass through quickly as we watched raptor videos in the comfort of the office. However, we were not blessed with such luck! Later, we made a trip to the Annex for a final visibility check and realized that neither nemesis would recede.<br/><br/>The raptors are still making their way through the Headlands, so we are hoping to catch sight of them again soon  especially the sought after Rough-legged Hawk! Hopefully the fog and rain subside in the days to come so hawkwatch on!<br/>

<p>Howdy readers!<br/><br/>Today was a cold and blustery fall day on the Hill. Temperatures were in the fifties and winds were from the south and southeast. Rain was viewable in the distance from both north and south quadrants and it sprinkled on us for a spell. <br/><br/>Raptor activity was low with 147 sightings. We hypothesized that this was due to the coming rain. Most activity was from Redtails, Harriers, and TVs. <br/><br/>Besides raptors, we saw Humpbacks in the Bay! Additionally, we spotted large amounts of Brown Pelicans and Common Murres feasting by the Gate. <br/><br/>Wednesday 1 persevered through the cold and saw some good sights on a slow day!<br/><br/>Hawkwatch out. <br/><br/>

<p>It was another sunny and cool day up on Hawk Hill. The winds were coming from the Northeast, and the temperatures hovered around sixty degrees Fahrenheit. There was also a strong glare on the water coming from the shining sun, yet we were able to spot some playful Humpbacks surfacing by the Bay's entrance.<br/><br/>With a couple of Harlan's Redtails seen in the last few days, we were on the hunt and hoping to spot some. No such luck! Nevertheless, we spotted five dark morph juvenile Redtails and one very light adult that peaked our interest! Our special buteo sightings did not stop there. We saw an adult Ferruginous rise up from the west, showing off its beautiful rufous tones along its back. Towards the end of the day, we spotted another large bird  it was a Swainie! All on the Hill were excited and thankful for the close looks at both incredibly cool species.<br/><br/>Hawkwatch on and out!<br/>

<p>Greetings readers!<br/><br/>It was a fair, sunny day on the Hill. Temperatures never broke 70 degrees Fahrenheit and winds never gusted past 5 mph until the afternoon. We saw western and northwestern winds appear after one pm. All in all, conditions were awesome for our hawkwatch team. <br/><br/>As far as raptor sightings are concerned, it was yet again Redtail central in the skies. Not to mention neck-craning central, as we all scoured the fifth quadrant cloud castle for raptors on the move. Besides our friendly Redtail visitors, including a few dark morph birds, the typical accipiter selection of Sharpies and Coops were far fewer than the past few Hawkwatch days-a sign of a final Redtail-dominant migratory push. Today was a nice Northern Harrier day, as we spotted juveniles left and right moving through the Hills or across the skies. Our day would not be complete without a few notable falcon sightings, including Peregrines and Merlins on the move! <br/><br/>Thanks to Monday 1 for another fun day on the Hill! Hawkwatch on. <br/><br/>

<p>Howdy readers!<br/><br/>Today was a beautiful and clear day for the Sunday 2 team! After getting an extra hour of sleep, we were all ready to get up on the Hill to count. We had a slightly chilly morning with temps in the low fifties. Winds were fairly slow and mostly coming from the northwest. <br/><br/>Our morning began with high Peregrine activity; a total of five were spotted before 11am and our total for the day was ten. Falcon activity continued to peak our interest, with fourteen Merlin and two male Kestrel sightings total. <br/><br/>Other notable highlights for the day included one juvenile Ferrug that flew over our heads and showed us its white belly. We also saw a juvenile Harlan's Redtail fly overhead; its coloration was a beautiful coal black. Tis the season of high Redtail activity; in total we had 243 sightings. To end our day, an adult male Harrier hunted the hillside in front of north quadrant. <br/><br/>Some exciting non-raptor sightings included Humpback Whales and porpoises in the Bay! Overall, the Sunday 2 team had another great day on the Hill. <br/><br/>Hawkwatch out. <br/><br/>

<p>The day started off with the Hill encapsulated in fog and temperatures in the mid-50s. Even though the fog lifted around 10 AM, there was minimal raptor activity. When the sun started shining, the raptors started flying. The day seemed to lull until someone from the west quadrant yelled We have a Ferrug over here! (the easiest way to wake up any hawkwatcher). The Ferruginous Hawk was circling low over the Rifle Range and gave us a great view of its three points of light. After that, the day seemed to pick up as we started seeing more raptors and more species. We saw many Harriers and Redtails but there was a surprisingly low amount of accipiter and vulture sightings. By the end of the day, the hills were peppered with Redtails, putting our hawkwatchers' tracking and passing skills to the test.<br/><br/>The highlight of the day was seeing two Bald Eagles, one adult and one subadult. Even though the adult was a far sighting over Alcatraz, the subadult flew closer to the Hill making its way through north quadrant. Along with the Ferrug, the other exciting species we got a close view of were Peregrines and Merlins. A pair of adult Peregrines rose up close to us on the north platform, giving us a show, and quite a few Merlins flew right over us.<br/><br/>We were glad the weather turned around and we had a productive day counting raptors! Hawkwatch on!<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p>Hello there hawk admirers!<br/><br/>We ventured up the Hill today hoping to count some raptors before getting rained out. Clouds rolled in from beyond Mt. Tam, but then passed over us without a drop. Instead of rain, we were cut short by heavy fog a little before 3 PM. It seems the hawks also anticipated inclement weather and perhaps hunkered down instead of flying by the Hill for us to count them. Our raptor sightings were lower than the past few days, giving us time to intermittently whale watch. What appeared to be an animated Humpback Whale entertained us by half breaching out of the water in a dramatic fashion. <br/><br/>We were primarily visited by Redtails and Turkey Vultures, a few of which decided to hang out with us for quite some time. In fact, one young Redtail stilled in over the south platform for most of the day. A pair of Turkey Vultures also decided to take a break to preen on a nearby rock in west quadrant. <br/><br/>Thank you to our visitors from the VA who kept us company and talked raptors with us this morning! We always appreciate the added enthusiasm and curiosity! <br/><br/>Stay dry this weekend and hawkwatch on!<br/>

<p>An amazing day for the Thursday II hawkwatch team! Although the forecast predicted a foggy day, we had beautiful and clear skies atop the Hill with temperatures reaching the high 60s! The winds were not too strong but they brought us many wonderful sightings nonethelesss.<br/><br/>The magical hour was between one and two in the afternoon. The hour started off with a breathtaking view of a White-tailed Kite that arose from Mt. Tam and circled above us before making its way across the Bay! Soon after, a large and dark bird flew past Angel Island and towards Slacker Hill - it was a subadult Bald Eagle! Just when we thought the day could not get any more exciting, two more sightings filled our eyes with joy. An adult Swainie joined a kettle of Redtails and Turkey Vultures along Slacker Hill. Last, but not least, an adult Harlan's Redtail was spotted by the north quadrant! Luckily, we had reviewed the unusual morph during our morning meeting and were euphoric that our lesson reinforced our skills that allowed us to properly identify it!<br/><br/>The days are getting shorter and colder, but we are excited for the increasing diversity still to come! Hawkwatch on!<br/>

<p>Hello enraptured readers!<br/><br/>Today was a sunny day with ominous fog threatening to invade the Headlands. We were worried our day might be cut short, but the weather was on our side (for once!). The north wind pushed the encroaching fog south to the city, leaving our views clear. Temperatures remained in the pleasant mid-sixties and there was a slight breeze throughout the day.<br/><br/>Today was another great falcon day with a total of three male Kestrel, twelve Merlin, and six Peregrine sightings! Our banders picked up a suspected Peale's Peregrine that perched in front of north quadrant for the hawkwatchers to admire. The skies were alive with the flight of Merlins! These tiny tyrants harassed all raptors in their path. <br/><br/>It seems as though Redtail activity is increasing as we approach our second Redtail peak. In total, there were 175 sightings, including four dark morphs. Several large kettles of Redtails formed and then reformed in west quadrant at different points in the day. <br/><br/>Our Wednesday II team was incredibly grateful for the retreat of the fog and the stellar raptor activity today! Happy hawkwatching!<br/><br/>

<p>This is hawkwatch Tuesday II team reporting from Hawk Hill on a sunny Halloween day!<br/><br/>We had a spooky start to our day as we spotted a "Grey Ghost" haunting the hills! Ghosts were not the only things seen on the Hill - we had many pumpkins floating past our heads as juvenile Northern Harriers made their way south and across the Golden Gate Bridge. In addition, not unlike bats, many Merlins dashed across the skies with pointed wings and determination throughout the day. A flash of gold also caught our sight as a Golden Eagle appeared and disappeared behind Mt. Tam mid-afternoon. Another mystical apparition glossed through the north quadrant when a White-tailed Kite was carried by the westerly winds. <br/><br/>The hawkwatchers were in a Halloween spirit and showed up in costume! A ladybug, a White-tailed Kite, a Bald Eagle, a Freudian slip, a Star Trek crew woman, and the Marin Headlands infamous five-minute tunnel all made an appearance! Overall, a fun time on the Hill. We remain hopeful to be the first team to spot a Rough-legged Hawk, but for now, Happy Halloween and hawkwatch on!<br/>

<p>When arriving at the Hill in the morning, hawkwatchers bundled up in all of the layers they brought, hoping that it was enough to keep them warm. The temperature started in the mid-50s and warmed up into the mid-60s by the end of the day, but it was the wind that concerning. We were lucky we weren't blown off the Hill with gusts over thirty miles per hour, but hawkwatchers weren't the only ones struggling to stay upright! Sharpies were being blown backwards... or were they showing us their best in-flight moon walk? Who's to say?<br/><br/>Unlike the hawkwatchers, the falcons seemed to love the wind. The day was dominated by zooming Merlins and circling Peregrines, which concluded with a 2-on-1 Peregrine Falcon battle royale between two adults and a juvenile above south platform. We could even hear their fierce battle squeaks! The other excitement of the day was buteo in nature.  We spotted two Ferruginous Hawks which graced us with their presence. The first one was a juvenile that performed a victory lap over our heads and around the Hill. The second Ferruginous Hawk stayed at a distance around Slacker Hill and showed rufous tones in its tail, indicating that it was an adult! In other buteo news, we saw the darkest of dark morph Redtails. This juvenile was such a solid chocolatey brown that it almost looked black like a Turkey Vulture.<br/><br/>It was worth braving the powerful winds on the Hill to see some amazing raptors! Hawkwatch on! <br/><br/><br/>

<p>Howdy readers!<br/><br/>The Sunday 1 team was dismayed to see fog as they arrived in the Marin Headlands this morning. We walked around the Lagoon, part of the Miwok Trail and stopped by the Visitor Center. We saw a juvenile Redtail perched on a telephone pole outside of the Visitor Center. As we watched the raptor through our binoculars, it devoured a small rodent bit by bit. How appetizing! Later, it was chased off by a couple of particularly upset crows.<br/> <br/>At the Lagoon we saw a variety of water birds, such as Western Grebes, Ring-necked Ducks, Eared Grebes, American Wigeons, Surf Scoters, and more! <br/><br/>On our walk along the Miwok we watched a female Kestrel hover hunt but besides this brave sole there was little raptor activity. <br/><br/>We then traveled to the Annex in hopes that the Hill would clear. However, the fog continued to sock us in and we called it a day. Hoping for some better luck next cycle!<br/><br/>Hawkwatch out. <br/><br/>

<p>Today we were welcomed on the Hill by a very dense fog inversion layer. With barely the tip of the North tower on the Golden Gate Bridge visible and a couple of delays due to the fog, we started our count a bit later than usual.<br/><br/>Although we only had 139 sightings, we got to see some raptors up close. One of the first sightings of the day was an adult Peregrine that flew right across our north and east quadrants and headed towards the City. Throughout our short time on the Hill, we also experienced a small flurry of Sharpies, some of which were adults!<br/><br/>After battling the fog for visibility all day, it eventually enveloped the Hill, abruptly ending our count for the day. However, before leaving, we spotted a young couple on a picnic overlooking the Golden Gate that ended in a proposal! As the young woman said yes, shouts of joy and a standing ovation greeted the couple and they parted from the Hill.  In the same spot a couple of hours earlier, a talented violinists was recording her music, filling our ears with joy. Overall, an exciting, yet strange, day on Hawk Hill!<br/><br/>Hawkwatch on!<br/>

<p>Another warm day on Hawk Hill. Although the temperatures were predicted to cool down from the last couple of days, we reached 89 degrees Farenheit during the hottest hour. The wind did not join us on our count today; still, some raptors were seen by the Friday I team!<br/><br/>Despite the slow raptor traffic (even the Turkey Vultures were absent for the first half of the day), we had a few interesting sightings on the Hill. We spotted fourteen falcons throughout the day, all making a speedy trek across the Headlands. We were also joined by two school groups who were learning about raptors through our Migratory Story Program in partnership with the Crissy Field Center - both fifth graders and high school students alike were delighted to catch a glimpse of the migrating raptors flying overhead.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the day, a rare individual was spotted by the north quadrant. A male Northern Harrier, a.k.a. a Grey Ghost, was hugging the ground while hunting! Unlike the juvenile and the female Harriers, the males have a striking grey plumage both on their backs and across the bellies, thus their nickname. <br/><br/>In other news, we saw 2,755 Band-tailed Pigeons! Although peak migration is nearing its end, many raptors are still being spotted. We await the coming of the next round of Redtails and more adult raptors migrating through!<br/><br/>Hawkwatch on!<br/>

<p>Hello raptor enthusiasts!<br/><br/>The high morning winds continued and once again we were welcomed to the Hill by our two adult Peregrines! The heat also persisted with temperatures in the eighties and winds consistently coming from the northeast. <br/><br/>Rising up from the Golden Gate was a picturesque Osprey that made its way to Hawk Hill and flew right over south quadrant! This wasn't the only bird to strain our necks in the fifth quadrant today. We were joined on the Hill by some close flying Redtails, Coops, Sharpies, Merlins, some playful Peregrines, and a lovely White-tailed kite. The close-up details were worth the neck pain! Not only did we see our fair share of juvenile Harriers, but we also spotted the whole family  an adult female and an adult male Harrier!<br/><br/>Another spectacular sight appeared from just beyond the Golden Gate in the afternoon. Hundreds of Band-tailed Pigeons formed a spiraling pigeon tornado several stories high! It was quite a breathtaking sight to see!<br/><br/>Late in the afternoon as the flow of raptor sightings began to slow down, a dark morph Broadwing circled above the north tower of the Golden Gate. This chocolate chunk caused quite a stir on the Hill as it is a little late in the season for Broadwings. We didn't mind the surprise straggler one bit! <br/><br/>It was a busy late season day on the Hill and we couldn't be happier!<br/><br/>Hawkwatch out!<br/><br/>

<p>Greetings! <br/><br/>Today was a hot day on the Hill with temperatures reaching 86 degrees Fahrenheit by 1pm. Winds were out of the northeast, but not gusty for very long, if at all. Visibility was good. The Farallon Islands were seen during the latter half of the day. <br/><br/>Here are some memorable moments among our 417 raptor-sightings! <br/><br/>-A beautiful juvenile Golden Eagle spotted by intern, Lara, under the Golden Gate! You could clearly see the three points of light (two on either wing, one on the tail). <br/>-Dark morph Redtails, two juveniles and one adult spotted today.

<p>Howdy, readers! <br/><br/>Today was a very windy day on the Hill, with gusts in the high 20s - pushing our hawkwatchers and hawks alike all around the Hill, setting them off to a great day of counting. Not unlike recent days, we were greeted by a pair of adult Peregrines. Falcons excel in high winds like these-- by the end of the day we saw four Merlins and one male Kestrel. <br/><br/>As the day went on, the winds died down and the temperatures heated up to the mid 80s. However, this did not stop the raptor sightings. Today was filled with adult accipiters; we saw a total of twenty-six individuals. Other highlights included one juvenile Swainie that rose up and gave a delightful suprise to those in the north quadrant and a White-tailed Kite that flew by close. A lot of Northern Harriers have been making their way over to the Hill and today was no exception! We saw a total of eleven individuals. <br/><br/>Birds weren't the only thing kiting today, for we saw ballooning spiders sailing with the wind and reaching great heights! A fun fact about these spiders is that their flight can take them up to Mt. Everest, a feat which few people can accomplish!  <br/><br/>Overall, a successful day was had by all on the Tuesday 1 team. Hoping for more fun days to come.<br/><br/>Hawkwatch on.  <br/>

<p>Today was another beautiful day on the Hill! In the morning, the wind was blustery and reached up to 18 miles per hour. The sun was shining bright all day so after the wind died down it started to heat up, eventually reaching a high of 82 degrees Fahrenheit. Visibility was exceptionally clear and there wasn't a cloud in the sky, perfect for spotting raptors.<br/><br/>Today's notable sightings included many adult accipiters and juvenile Harriers. We even saw a juvenile Sharpie and an adult Sharpie flying together  perfect for comparing the plumage differences of the two! If you are on the Hill, make sure to look out for the blue back and orange barring on the belly of those adult accipiters. Orange can also be spotted on juvenile Harriers that have solid orange underparts. Throughout the day, they were combing the hillsides for a tasty snack! Additionally, two Merlins flew over the Hill together in the afternoon, giving hawkwatchers a close look at these fast falcons. <br/><br/>Looking forward to more beautiful days to come! <br/><br/>Hawkwatch on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p>Howdy readers!<br/><br/>There wasn't a cloud in the sky today on the Hill! Conditions were fairly still, with wind coming from the North and temperatures in the sixties. The Sunday 2 team was excited to see some raptors and with snacks in tow we were ready to count.<br/><br/>We had two great views of Peregrines today. One adult flew right over our heads and we got a great look at its muttonchops. Later in the day, a juvenile Peregrine made several dives right in front of the north quadrant. While on the topic of falcons, we also saw three Merlins today! One of these speedy falcons zoomed up from the west quadrant and raced through our view. <br/><br/>Other great sights today included two White-tailed Kites and one Ferrug. The Kite fluttered up from Slacker Hill while the juvenile Ferrug rose up before our eyes in the west and north quadrants. <br/><br/>All in all, another great Sunday! Our banding docent gave a wonderful talk and showed a female Coop to a large crowd of visitors. Next weekend is the last Hawk Talk and Raptor Release of the season so make sure to stop by the Hill! <br/><br/>Hawkwatch out. <br/><br/>

<p>Greetings readers!<br/><br/>It was a fair day on the Hill to count raptors! The weather was literally the best we have had in a while - no joke! The temperature reached 71.1 degrees Fahrenheit at 3pm with light winds mainly from the north and southeast. The sun was shining with blue skies about-quite a contrast from our smoky and foggy days recently! <br/><br/>We saw 317 raptor individuals from the Hill today. Early on, east quadrant spotted an adult Red-shouldered Hawk coasting down the hill towards Kirby Cove. What a sight it was! We could clearly see the russet red shoulders, beautiful checkboard wings, and striped tail. After several moments of awe over the beauty that is Red-shoulder Hawks, we happened upon our usual assemblage of Turkey Vultures, accipiters, and Red-tailed Hawks. An interesting note of the day was seeing all three subspecies (Prairie, Taiga, Black) of Merlin from the Hill. If you get a chance, have a look at those plumage color differences between the three. Seeing a Black Merlin was a great sight as we generally see more Prairie and Taiga around. <br/><br/>A humorous moment on the Hill occurred in the late afternoon with a silly juvenile Redtail. This individual picked up what appeared to be a snake right beyond Fish Rock. After further study, the snake turned out to be a stick! A really snake-like stick, if we might add. Funny moment! <br/><br/>This is the second of the last week of Hawktalks and Raptor Release programs on the Hill. Come check out our final programs of this season tomorrow, next weekend, or both! Today there was a class from the Golden Gate Audubon to enjoy our programs and see hawks. Happy to have you all out!  <br/><br/>Hawkwatch on. <br/><br/>

<h2><a name='20171020'/>Friday, October 20, 2017</h2>
<p>Hello fellow bird nerds!<br/><br/>On this lovely Friday we were greeted by thick fog on the Hill that made it difficult to see north from south quadrant. This delayed our start time by forty minutes, but the conditions quickly shifted to quite clear views and mild temperatures in the sixties. As the fog was rolling out, we noticed an upwelling of bugs from the ground in east quadrant. Termites took flight and twinkled in the light streaming through the clouds, providing an astounding view (or horrifying depending on your feelings about insect swarms) in front the Golden Gate. After some time, their wings fell off and ants could be seen hauling the wings away into their homes. The termites also were a tasty snack for swooping White-throated Swifts. Anyway, let's talk raptors. <br/><br/>The first hour was dominated by Harriers, Peregrines, and, of course, Turkey Vultures (those wobbly rascals)! Shout out to south quadrant for spotting some of our more exciting views of the day, including a Peregrine in hot pursuit of a juvenile Harrier! This Peregrine met up with their partner in crime (their mate) above the platform in south quadrant and hung out while hawkwatchers looked on in awe. We were also revisited by our color-banded juvenile Redtail that is frequently seen hovering incredibly close to hawkwatchers on the Hill. We were able to read the band and identify this bird as the same one that enjoys playing with sticks. This time he was joined by another color-banded juvenile Redtail with matching lavender legwear. <br/><br/>We have some lovely weather in the forecast this week, so why not join us and the birds on Hawk Hill?<br/><br/>

<p>Howdy readers!<br/><br/>Today we were unable to count do to the fog but we did welcome the much needed moisture in the air. The Thursday 2 team started the morning with a walk along the Miwok Trail where we saw Redtails, a juvenile Harrier, and two juvenile Coops. <br/><br/>We then ventured up to the Annex where we observed some interesting raptor interactions. We watched as two adult Retails chase off other hawks, including Redtails and one Redshoulder. One of the chased off Redtails was then stooped on by a Sharpie. What a bad day for that fella! Additionally, we got to see a juvenile Harrier hunting the hillside right before our eyes. A few accipiters flew through, including an adult Sharpie. We could see its rufous belly even in the fog.<br/><br/>Although we wished we could get up to the Hill, the Thursday 2 team managed to see some exciting birds today!<br/><br/>Hawkwatch out. <br/><br/>

<p>Greetings raptor fans!<br/><br/>After the toasty conditions of late we were happy to see our old pal Karl the Fog. We decided to go up to the Hill, but we soon discovered the fog had consumed all quadrants save one patch of blue in the 5th quadrant above our heads. The team hunkered down and shared bird tales while we waited for improved visibility. The fog came in and out much like the tides on the shore, taunting us with momentary blue skies and views of the headlands. Due to the strange conditions we were only able to count for 3.75 hours before we were completely socked in. <br/><br/>During these clear windows of time we were able to get up to ten species in our short day of counting! Shout out to the Wednesday II team for sticking it out in the cold fog and keeping their eyes on the prize (the prize being some good looking birds). And what stunning birds we had!<br/><br/>As we had our binoculars locked on a Coop, out of the fog appeared a feisty Merlin who pounced on the unsuspecting accipiter. The Merlin fled the scene and disappeared back from whence it came. Intern Lara observed, the Merlin made a stoopy stoop on that Coopy Coop. So true, Lara, so true. <br/><br/>Before the fog overtook us, we saw one final handsome bird. Out above the rifle range the team noticed an unusual buteo. We observed the darkness of the flight feathers and pointed wing shape. After the oohs and ahs subsided, we added one juvenile Swainson's Hawk to our list! <br/><br/>Although we did not count for the full six hours, the Wednesday II team managed to pull together a pretty great list of raptor species. Go team!<br/><br/>Hawkwatch out!<br/><br/>

<p>Greetings readers! <br/><br/>The day started out hazy, as a lack of wind kept the smoke layer low. Temperatures reached the low 80's and high 70's throughout the morning and early afternoon. Visibility was low in all quadrants for the duration of our half-day count. Yet again, the smoke levels reached a point of no return, ending our day around 1:30pm.  <br/><br/>Today, we witnessed both hazy, far away and close-by raptor sightings. The usual assemblage of Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawk, Sharp-shinned Hawk and Cooper's Hawk were seen. All of our common raptorial stars had lower counts than usual. We saw a number of Harriers showing off juvenile pumpkin belly plumage. A White-tailed Kite was seen flying through north quadrant around noon, which was a great sight as well. On the falcon front, one Merlin and one Peregrine Falcon were spotted. The true bird stars of the day (emphasis on the plural of stars!) are the mighty Band-tailed Pigeon totaling 1,908 individuals. Go pigeons! <br/><br/>On a different note, leaving the Hill early is a bummer, as it usually is due to conditions beyond our humanly control. On days like today, I find myself feeling extremely thankful for our amazing Hawkwatch teams, with such dedication and obvious excitement for counting raptors, as well as the countless raptor views during fall migration.   <br/> <br/>Hawkwatch out. <br/><br/>

<p>When we first made it up to the Hill we thought it was going to be another blustery day in which we would have to keep a sharp eye on our scopes lest they topple off the Hill. But boy, were we wrong. By the afternoon the winds completely dropped off and it got toasty on the Hill with temperatures reaching 81 degrees Fahrenheit. We went from trying to keep our binoculars steady to trying to keep them from getting sweaty!<br/><br/>We were greeted in the morning by two adult Peregrines that were uncharacteristically hanging out above our heads (instead of the usual acrobatic diving on other birds in the distance). We were also treated to some great looks of adult Coops and Sharpies who were showing off their blue-gray backs and rufous bellies.  Two Redshoulders playfully flew past the Hill and their wing crescents matched the smiles of the hawkwatchers admiring their presence. The raptor activity in the afternoon slowed down, but the mystical afternoon Merlin we spotted sure didn't.<br/><br/>We were happy to be up on the Hill today and hope that conditions continue to improve.  Keep your eyes to the sky because the raptors are flying high!<br/><br/>

<p>The Sunday 1 team was delighted to be able to go up on the Hill today. The winds were fierce as we walked up but conditions were clear throughout the day. Gusts were nearly 30 mph as the day started but slowed down as the count went on.<br/><br/>The first sights of the day were two adult Peregrines braving the wind. They looked as if they were flying backwards as they fought to stay afloat. Around noon everyone had their eyes on a juvenile Golden Eagle that steadily made its way through the west and north quadrants. Around this time we also saw two White-tailed Kites soar across the sky. Today was also a good day for dark morphs; we saw two adult and two juvenile Redtails. <br/><br/>Various songbirds are also migrating through the Headlands. Our Band-tailed Pigeon count got up to 631 and we spotted other migratory passerines such as Yellow-rumped Warblers, Cedar Waxwings, and Lesser Goldfinches. <br/>We are all happy that the smoke subsided today and are still sending good thoughts to those affected by the fires.<br/> <br/>Hawkwatch out. <br/><br/>

<p>Regarding North Bay fires and smoke:<br/>Changing winds from NE yesterday to NW today pushed much of the smoke from the Marin Headlands today, allowing us to do a hawk count.  Given the changing winds and continued actively burning areas, smoke conditions, and air health will be a daily decision for GGRO staff and volunteers for the coming days and perhaps weeks.  Visitors should make their own decisions about the constantly changing air conditions also weighing in their own vulnerability to smoke.  Please do not call the GGRO for conditions.  Conditions are highly variable on a micro-geographic level.<br/><br/>The hawk flight was high up and diverse in species today.  Some of the best counts and views of Northern Harriers this season.  A close-up juvenile Ferruginous Hawk soaring just above some 30 juv Turkey Vultures was particularly impressive.  Six Merlins, 4 kites, two Brodies, and two Swainies rounded out the unusual species.<br/><br/>Sending good thoughts to all our raptor colleagues in the North Bay.<br/>

<p>Today was a strange smoky day on the Hill. The day started off with a particularly orange sunrise and campfire air due to multiple wildfires up north. When we first made it to the Hill there was low visibility but nothing could stop our Saturday I team as we all dawned facemasks and grabbed our binoculars. When the wind picked up later in the day it began to clear and the air quality improved! The sun was also shining causing the temperatures to rise to a high of 82 degrees Fahrenheit at 2:00 PM.  But even with all the haze we were still able to spot raptors! <br/><br/>Some notable sightings from today were three close-by adult Peregrines that circled the Hill and a White-tailed Kite that almost passed overhead. We also spotted a few juvenile Redshoulders and Harriers. Other than that, we mostly saw the usual accipiters, Redtails, and Turkey Vultures with most of the raptor activity occurring from 10am-2pm with a slow down at the end of the day.  <br/><br/>The raptors are still migrating, so we're still watching! Hawkwatch on!<br/><br/><br/>

<p>Hello readers! Happy Fleet Week! Today was a clear, sunny, and beautiful day up on the Hill. Temperatures were in the high 70s with little wind coming mostly from the North. Overall today was a fabulous day with thirteen species and a lot of exciting sights. <br/><br/>Besides various planes to keep us busy, we had a good flow of raptors today with 89 HPH. We saw three White-tailed Kites today, all of which flew in close and looked incredibly angelic. Another highlight of the day was a juvenile Ferrug that flew in from the Lagoon and crossed all the way to the tip of Slacker Hill. Everyone was in awe over our favorite big white buteo. <br/><br/>West quadrant spotted a buteo take off from its perch and immediately clash with a Redtail. After further inspection, this mysterious buteo turned out to be a juvenile Swainson's! It showed us its pointed, long wings and dark flight feathers and then we knew. Today also gifted us with a lot of Harriers; we ended the day with a total of twenty-six, including one adult female. Another fun (and adorable) sight of the day was a Blue-gray Gnatcatcher getting chased by a Vanessa butterfly. <br/><br/>Although no planes unearthed any Short-eared Owls like they did on Thursday 2, we had a great and exciting day on the Hill.<br/><br/>Hawkwatch out. <br/><br/>

<p>Today was a slow day but we saw some amazing raptors and planes! The day started off with little to no wind and a temperature of 83 degrees. We were preparing for another very hot day, but fortunately the wind picked up from the west around 1:00 PM to cool us off and send some raptors our way! Unfortunately, there wasn't a high amount of raptor activity but we did see eleven species and witness some fun occurrences. <br/><br/>One occurrence happened while watching a perched Cooper's Hawk.  It took flight and chased after a rabbit! We didn't see the outcome of this encounter, but it was exciting to see anyway! We also came across a pesky scrub-jay that swiped a cookie from the hawkwatch snack cache behind our backs. It sure looked cute munching on an owl-shaped cookie! And lastly, we saw almost 600 Band-tailed Pigeons migrating across the sky in flocks. <br/><br/>Similar to yesterday, military planes were flying over our heads in celebration of Fleet Week! But surprisingly, we weren't joined by the mass number of onlookers that have shown up on this day in the past. Nonetheless, we enjoyed each other's company on a day full of hawkwatching fun! <br/><br/><br/>

<p>What a beautiful day! The sun was shining and there wasn't a cloud in sight! The temperature slowly climbed to about 87 degrees Fahrenheit with only a slight breeze to cool us off a bit. The birds were feeling the heat too as the flight picked up later in the day. The highlight of the day was the appearance of three Golden Eagles! We spotted two juveniles and one adult throughout the day. The juveniles were bright and shiny with their young brown and white feathers and the adult was chocolatey brown, all showing off their namesake golden napes. We also saw White-tailed Kites sail across the south quadrant on their way to the city! Later in the day, the hawkwatchers were treated to a new kind of bird in the sky - the super-fast blue and yellow type.  The Blue Angels showed us their best Merlin impression with their quick and coordinated maneuvers! But even with all the excitement, there were still raptors to be seen.<br/><br/>Overall, this toasty day produced some great hawkwatching and thrilling views. Happy Fleet Week and keep your eyes to the skies for raptors and planes!<br/><br/>

<p>What a slow start to the day! For the first three hours up on the Hill we barely counted 120 raptors. The sun was beating down on us and there was no relief from the heat due to the nonexistent winds - but we remained resilient. After noon, activity picked up a bit, and aside from the usual suspects we also observed some Redshoulders, Broadwings, Kestrels, and Harriers.<br/><br/>The last thirty minutes of the count provided some especially interesting sightings! Things were still relatively slow until one of our hawkwatchers shouted, "Ferrug!" It was a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk, and soon enough, everyone was taking turns on the scopes, hoping to get a good look at its fun array of rusty grey and white colors! Soon after, three juvenile Harriers were spotted, one of which was playing with its food, dropping it and swooping down to catch it again! Did its parents not teach it that you should not play with your food? Nevertheless, it was very entertaining!<br/><br/>We're hoping more accipiters are still on their way and there will be many more fun days to come. Hawkwatch on!<br/>

<p>After getting fogged out three cycles in a row, our Wednesday II team was ecstatic to be up on the Hill! Though we spent the last count days at the annex below the fog, today we were above it with an inverted fog layer rolling in around two. In the morning we were greeted with clear skies and temperatures in the sixties. <br/><br/>A major highlight of the day was seeing a few adult accipiters. These mature birds showed off their blue-gray backs and rufous bellies to our excited hawkwatchers. This is the time of year that we start to see more adults on the Hill and we are delighted by their arrival. Other than accipiters, we also saw an adult female Harrier! This lovely lady flew over west quadrant and showed off her beautiful streaked belly. <br/><br/>Enjoy these lovely Hawktober days everyone! Hawkwatch out!<br/><br/>

<p>Another fantastic day on the Hill! The sun was shining and winds were blowing mostly from the west — good conditions for the hawks to take to the skies and head south.<br/><br/>We saw a variety of species, with a total of fourteen for the day! While the majority of the birds were the usual suspects (Redtails, accipiters, and Turkey Vultures), we caught sight of more rare individuals. Our first treat was a nice look at a subadult Bald Eagle — it had some noticeable white markings along its back and belly. Then, the more elusive of the falcons — the Prairie Falcon — made its way across the north quadrant before heading towards the Golden Gate. Later, a large, light buteo emerged from that same quadrant and flew along Slacker ridge as we all rejoiced at seeing the seventh Ferruginous Hawk of the season! Last, but not least, a distant Swainie was spotted along Angel Island, hanging out with a group of Turkey Vultures.<br/><br/>All in all, a day filled with wonderful and exciting sightings! Looking forward to seeing those adult raptors everyone keeps talking about, so stay tuned and hawkwatch on!<br/>

<p>Welcome to Hawktober! <br/><br/>Lovely weather on the Hill today with temperatures in the low seventies and a slight wind starting from the east and moving from the west in the afternoon. Though slow to start, the raptor activity picked up around 11:00 AM. <br/><br/>During day two of Hawktoberfest we saw some exciting sightings (or as we like to call them exsightings). We were graced by the presence of a White-tailed Kite rising up from the lagoon and then flying over to visit San Francisco. Also seen in the west quadrant was a magnificent juvenile Ferruginous Hawk that flew right over our heads! Hawkwatchers rejoiced, merriment ensued, interns danced, the Hill was alive with the sound of happy hawkwatchers! <br/><br/>When the day started to slow down, we were still entertained by an interesting young Redtail. This whippersnapper broke off a stick from a nearby bush and chewed on the bark and moss while stilling just beyond west quadrant. The Redtail would drop the stick from up high and then dive down to catch it! This behavior was repeated multiple times to the delight of everyone on the Hill. The bird was close enough that we noticed some jewelry (AKA bands) on its legs that we can use to gather data about where the bird has been! <br/><br/>Happy hawkwatching! <br/><br/>

<p>Today was a sunny day, with temperatures in the mid-seventies and winds variable throughout. While the wind made our hawkwatchers happy, this caused flurries of raptors throughout the day. We had a busy day with 93 raptors per hour, but we never felt like we were drowning in raptor activity! That's not to say that we didn't see amazing raptors on the Hill! <br/><br/>Here are a few highlights:<br/><br/>-A White-tailed Kite graced us with its presence as it flew across Angel Island. And what an angel it was! <br/><br/>-Amongst the 24 Broad-winged Hawks we saw today, two were dark morph juveniles. One gave the Hawk Talk goers a show!<br/> <br/>-The north and west quadrants spotted an adult female Peregrine falcon. She showed off her cool black helmet (or mutton chops!) as she flew over the Hill. <br/><br/>-Lara gave a rousing Hawktalk to a group of 30 or so visitors to the Hill. Our lovely banding docents and former interns, Carmen and Lynn, showed all a beautiful Cooper's Hawk at 1pm too. If you were a visitor on the Hill today, you got a healthy dose of GGRO information and hospitality! Thanks for coming out!<br/> <br/>Hawkwatch out. <br/><br/>

<p>The sun was brightly shining as hawkwatchers walked up the trail to Hawk Hill, full of hope for a busy day of counting ahead. The elusive Ferruginous Hawk was present in everyone's minds as the anticipated first sighting of the season had not occurred yet. It was past noon, and the day was going well — almost 250 birds had been counted already — when it happened. While scanning the skies for the typical suspects, someone cried, Ferrug! Very far in the distance! and all hawkwatchers turned to the north quadrant, where said bird soared high in the blue. With the first one spotted, everyone was excited to get a closer look — and about an hour later, they all got their wish! Not just one more but TWO Ferrugs came close to the Hill, resulting in celebratory dancing from apprentices, interns, and veteran hawkwatchers alike.<br/><br/>Another elusive raptor made a grandiose appearance in significant numbers. Six White-tailed Kites were seen on the Hill! They were spotted mostly in pairs, and one individual even flew above the hawkwatchers, providing a great view of their carpal patches and smooth flight. An even earlier treat for the people on the Hill occurred in the morning when a kettle of eleven Broadwings formed above the Golden Gate Bridge — with two dark morphs in the mix! <br/><br/>The rest of the day did not disappoint, as a good number of species flew over the Hill in great numbers! Overall, it was a fantastic day for the Saturday 1 team! Let's hope peak migration continues to make its way over Hawk Hill so hawkwatch on!<br/>

<p>What a day on the Hill! With wind speeds reaching over twenty-seven miles per hour, it felt like the birds were not the only ones being blown off the hills. Despite the cloudiness that loomed over our heads most of the day, we had a good number of birds passing through the Headlands today. Peak migration seems to be going through some ups and downs, and today was definitely an in-between. We saw almost sixty Sharpies and 135 Redtails but only twenty-seven Coops. However, dark morphs are moving, and we got to see some nice individuals — an adult Redtail and a Broadwing! <br/><br/>After the fog receded later in the day, we were hoping to finish up with beautiful, clear, blue skies, but there were other plans in store. Around three o'clock, the fog rolled back in, enveloping all quadrants but the East and forcing hawkwatchers to retreat from the Hill. Nevertheless, we had a wonderful day and remain hopeful that the weather will bring some interesting species in the coming days say, maybe a Ferrug! <br/><br/>Have a birdy-ful weekend and hawkwatch on!<br/><br/>

<p>I got sunshine on a foggy day sang Bob Power, our wonderful volunteer. Truer lyrics have never been sung, as we experienced a stunning display of fog inversion on Hawk Hill today. It felt as though the hawkwatchers were on top of Mount Olympus looking down upon the fog covered bay from our sunny perch. As temperatures increased, the fog rolled out and we enjoyed clear views for the rest of the day. <br/><br/>We were delighted to see thirty-six Broadwings, one of which was a dark morph or, as our banding manager Teresa would call them, little chocolate chunks. <br/><br/>Much like love, the skies were a battlefield. The west quadrant witnessed two juvenile Harriers duel it out in the valley. Towards the end of the day two juvenile Redtails dive bombed each other right in front of the north platform. A raven flew after one Redtail who then promptly turned the tables and chased off the raven. <br/><br/>Overall, another stellar day for Thursday 1! Hawkwatch out!<br/><br/>

<p>Hello readers! Today marked another very successful day up on the Hill! The Wednesday 1 team was greeted with clear skies and an easterly wind in the morning. Temperatures got up to the high 80s and our cooling breeze died down for a few hours before coming back strong for our last hour of counting.<br/><br/>There was a good flow of raptors throughout the day, marked by some heavy bursts of raptor traffic. Some notable sights included a great flight of a dark morph adult Redtail that put on a show for the photographers on the Hill. Additionally, we saw a juvenile Golden Eagle fly up right into the sky overhead; it displayed its pure white wing patches on its outer wings and on its tail. My personal favorite sight of the day was a dark morph Broadwing that came from the north quadrant and flew over us to the east quadrant. It had a beautiful, deep chocolate brown coloration and everyone was in awe.<br/><br/>Overall, Wednesday 1 had a great day with some stellar views of migrating raptors! We're excited for more hawks to come.<br/><br/>Hawkwatch out. <br/><br/>

<p>Who said peak was not here yet? Over 100 raptors per hour were seen today! We were not only rich in numbers, but in species as well. They were everywhere! Over fifth quadrant, over the lagoon, in front of our faces, far in the distance there was a constant stream of raptors all day. Besides our typical stream of accipiters, we had a generous sprinkle of unusual species.<br/><br/>Some of these exciting sightings included a Swainson's feasting on a dragonfly in flight. Throughout the day, many a Broadwing flew directly overhead, giving us a good look at their lackluster field marks. In addition, we had three Golden Eagles in sight — one of which circled around us and was then harassed by a small accipiter. We also had some good views of multiple Merlins, Redshoulders, and Ospreys!<br/><br/>Overall, it was quite a warm day but filled with a lot of activity and excitement! Stay cool in the coming days and hawkwatch on!<br/>

<p>Today was a clear, sunny day with little wind to speak of. The air temperatures reached 87 degrees Fahrenheit by 3pm. Overall, there was low Raptor activity. Yet, at many points of the day we were surprised by groups of raptors in the sky! <br/><br/>A few exciting points include: a long view of a White-tailed Kite flying low through the east and north quadrants, and Broadwings everywhere! Particularly in the 5th quadrant found high up in the sky! Pro tipdon't look into the giant glowing sun ball, even if a tempting bird is nearby! We saw all falcons but Prairie falcons on the Hill today. Additionally, a juvenile Northern Harrier flew so close to us in the north quadrant that we could see its facial disk! <br/><br/>So, despite the warm weather, we were treated to some special raptors after all! Don't forget your sunscreen and wide-brimmed hat for the sunny days to come! <br/><br/>

<p>Howdy readers! Today Sunday 2 had an extremely successful and fun day. The skies were clear the entire day with temperatures in the low 70s. A northwest wind helped us see some very interesting birds. We beat the previous record of most species seen this season by 1, having seen a total of 14 species today. <br/><br/>Early in the day, the west quadrant spotted a rare visitoran adult male Harrier! Its pale gray coloration made it stand out against the blue sky. All quadrants got a spectacular view of a Prairie Falcon that zoomed through the north quadrant and gave us good flashes of its dark wingpits. Cheers were had by all once the Merlins were seen, adding to the previously seen Kestrels and Peregrines, and making this a four falcon day! <br/><br/>Later, the team also saw a few Broad-winged Hawks, one of which flew directly overhead. Around the same time the north quadrant spotted some far out Golden Eagles. A White-tailed Kite was also seen by some of our team members, bringing our species total up to fourteen. Additionally, we had some good flights of both Band-tailed Pigeons (246) and Vaux's Swifts (401). <br/><br/>What an exciting day! Good work Sunday 2.<br/><br/>Hawkwatch out. <br/><br/>

<p>Howdy, readers!<br/><br/>Today was a beautiful, clear day! Such a clear day that the Farallon Islands were visible all day! The temperature remained in the mid-seventies and the wind was blowing from the NW. It was an overall slow day in terms of raptor activity, but it was supplemented by a large number of visitors on the Hill and boats on the Bay enjoying the beautiful day! As with every weekend, we were delighted to share more information about the GGRO and the amazing raptors we observe with the visitors of Hawk Hill with our Hawk Talk and Raptor Release. These occur every weekend in September and October at noon and 1 PM, respectively — come and visit us!<br/><br/>Although there weren't as many raptors as expected today, there were some interesting peak migration sightings! We saw a lot of juvenile accipiters, a Redtail and Redshoulder flying together, and falcons in both the Kestrel and Peregrine variety. We also spotted couple of Osprey! Most of the raptors today were seen far overhead or in the distance but we did get a few close looks at some accipiters. <br/><br/>The raptors are coming and we are ready to see them so Hawkwatch on!<br/><br/>

<p>Our Friday II team was delighted to finally get up to the Hill after being fogged out for the first two cycles. And what a day it was! The weather was ideal with clear skies, temperatures in the mid-sixties, and a westerly wind. The day started out slow, but was rich in terms of species by the end of the day. Our wish for an up close look at a Broadwing was granted when one approached the Hill from a distance and circled over our heads! <br/><br/>We thought it couldn't get any better after we saw a close up sub-adult Bald Eagle in the west quadrant, but to our surprise we witnessed two more Bald Eagles — all with distinctive plumage! One eagle was a dark brown juvenile, while the other appeared to be a late sub-adult that could almost be mistaken for an adult due to the mottled white feathers on its head and tail. The eagle bonanza continued when out of the north quadrant appeared a juvenile Golden Eagle! The handsome eagle circled the quadrant for quite a while and everyone got a good look as a Redtail gave chase! As one our volunteers put it, the Redtail looked like a pigeon compared to the eagle! <br/><br/>Cheers to an amazing day on the Hill and many more to come!<br/><br/>

<p>What an exciting first day out for our Thursday 2 team! Although we were fogged out the past couple of times, we beat the record for the most number of species counted on the Hill this season — 13! Today was a beautiful and clear day, with temperatures in the high 60s. The wind was not very strong, but many birds roamed the skies.<br/><br/>The main highlights of the day included very good looks at unusual birds. Three juvenile dark morph Redtails displayed their chocolaty plumage, and later, we were all amazed by a very light morph Swainson's Hawk who came in from the beach. Towards the end of the day, a juvenile Bald Eagle steadily approached the Hill, converting four quadrants into one as it flew over our heads and all binoculars focused on its majestic soar.<br/><br/>Let's continue breaking records and hawkwatch on!<br/>

<p>Another wonderful day for our Tuesday 2 Team! The weather was sunny and clear, with good visibility and temperatures in the high 70s. There was a slight breeze out of the east that fluctuated in strength throughout the day.  Additional volunteers joined us for the count in anticipation of the glory that is peak raptor migration, as well as people interested in learning about the GGRO! They were treated to a close look at a Redtail and a stoop by a Peregrine.<br/><br/>Although the raptor traffic was not as congested as expected for this time of year, we spotted the first Broad-winged Hawks of the season — 3 Broadwings hanging out with a Redtail above the ridgeline in the north quadrant! Other than Redtails, we mostly saw accipiters with the occasional Kestrel, Peregrine, Merlin, and Harrier. In other (song bird) news, we saw a total of 66 Vaux's Swifts today that arrived in groups of 20. <br/><br/>Overall a wonderful day with wonderful people! Hope there are more Broadwing sightings to come so hawkwatch on!<br/><br/>

<p>Hello, hawkwatchers!<br/><br/>We were halfway through writing our blog after an incredibly foggy day at the Annex, when the sky unexpectedly opened up around 2 PM! Even though most of the team had called it for the day, we rushed up to the Hill to count what we could with a crew of five. We were delighted to have former interns Eric and Mark joining our ranks! The complete turnaround from not being able to see Kirby Cove from the Annex to being able to see the Farallon Islands from the Hill was astounding! It truly went from the foggiest to the clearest of days within an hour. <br/><br/>The birds seen were as astounding as the weather! A Peregrine flew close overhead as we hiked up the hill and a handful of other Peregrines made appearances after we were set up. The sky was filled with high-flying accipiters and close-flying Redtails. We even spotted a Prairie Falcon rising up from a nearby hill in the north quadrant! We watched in awe as the falcon zoomed towards Berkeley and out of our sights. <br/><br/>In all the excitement, we did not finish the latest hawk remix of your favorite hits. The song release will be pushed back to our next foggy day. Until then, enjoy the beautiful weather!<br/><br/>Hawkwatch out!<br/><br/>

<p>Greetings readers, and happy peak! <br/><br/>Today was truly a peak migration day by the total individuals seen (474!). Red-tailed Hawks (112) took the most seen prize but not without Sharp-shinned Hawks close behind (103). The accipiters are here! Not to mention some beautiful falcons like Merlins, Peregrines and Kestrels. We were fortunate to have a female Merlin at our weekend raptor release today. A large crowd gathered around for Lara's weekend HawkTalk and stuck around for the release. <br/><br/>Another interesting raptor interaction seen was between a Peregrine, Redtail and Sharpie. The Peregrine did a full stoop on the latter two birds to chase them off. Quite an exciting dive! What do you get when a Peregrine stoops on two other birds? A raptor sandwich! <br/><br/>All jokes aside, the day was extremely kind to us overall. There was slight fog cover in the morning hours with afternoon sun and breezes up to 4 MPH from the west by the end of the day. The highest temperature recorded was at 3 pm at 66 degrees Fahrenheit. A very pleasant day, raptors and all! <br/><br/>

<p>Another great day for our hawkwatchers! Although the sun remained hidden for most of the day, the hawks could not hide from us. In addition to our usual species, we saw a few interesting individuals. The first highlight of the day was a visit from an Osprey that flew very close to where we were standing. Then, the most exciting thing happened. A Redtail was being harassed by not one not two but THREE Peregrine Falcons — two of which were adults and one was a juvenile. One of the adults was putting up a show, making steep and measured dives at the Redtail — what a roller coaster! The excitement lasted for quite a while, and we were able to identify key differences between the adults and the juvenile.<br/><br/>We were not the only group enjoying the day on Hawk Hill. Whether it was for hawkwatching or just to take in the beautiful scenery, almost 200 people visited the Hill. Those that stuck around during the Hawk Talk and Raptor Release enjoyed seeing a young Sharpie take flight as it was released from the hands of GGRO Director, Allen Fish! If you missed it, there will be another tomorrow (weather permitting), so make sure to come out!<br/><br/>Enjoy the weekend and hawkwatch on!<br/><br/>

<p>Minimal clouds, a western breeze, and moderate temperatures - finally a perfect hawkwatching day for the Friday 1 Team! Not only was there a constant stream of people visiting Hawk Hill, the accipiters also arrived in great numbers. On Hawk Hill you could hear hawkwatchers yelling, Accipiter! Is it a Coop? Is it a Sharpie? Wait, look again! as friendly disputes would ensue over the fast flapping suspects. Safe to say we were able to work on our accipiter identification skills all day! The most exciting sightings of the day, however, were the close encounters we had with not one not two not even three, but FOUR Merlins! Overall, we had an eleven-species day, which included a very distant Bald Eagle, a Harrier, numerous Ospreys, Kestrels, and a handful of Redshoulders.<br/><br/>We're looking forward for what peak migration will bring! Who knows, hopefully we'll get to see a Broadwing, a Ferruginous Hawk, or maybe even a Prairie Falcon in the coming days!<br/>

<p>After the past couple of days of rain and fog, the Thursday 1 team was very excited to make it up to the Hill today. It started out cold and windy with temperatures in the high 50s. As the temperature increased during the day so did the number of hawks. <br/><br/>We had a total of eight Osprey today, many of which flew right overhead and gave us some nice views. There were some flashy and handsome male Kestrels flying close by as well. The banders caught both a female and a male Sharp-shinned Hawk, which gave our team a good opportunity to test our accipiter identification skills. We also saw a Merlin zoom in the distance from the north quadrant. After we finished counting for the day we spotted a juvenile and an adult Peregrine battling it out right before our very eyes. With all the birds around today it was hard to tell if we were the hawkwatchers or the hawkwatched!<br/><br/>Major shout out to the Thursday 1 team for getting up on the Hill every cycle this season! Let's keep the streak going.<br/><br/>Hawkwatch out. <br/><br/>

<p>There was no singing in the rain today as the Wednesday I hawkwatch team arrived in the Headlands. The day was foggy and rained mist intermittently much to our disappointment. Our lagoon trip was a successful time. We spotted a Sabine's Gull grounded on the bank. On our walk we came upon Townsend's Warblers, Common Yellowthroats, and Yellow Warblers. We also got some good views of both Pacific-slope and Willow Flycatchers on the trail. We ended the day with a raptor skins showing in anticipation of the (hopefully) upcoming Broad-winged and Ferruginous Hawk migration. Although we did not get up to the Hill, we had a great and informative time at GGRO headquarters. <br/>

<p>After a string of hot days, our hawkwatchers basked in the lovely weather on the Hill. We got our binoculars on some great views of Kestrels, Harriers, and Coops that all appeared to be enjoying the day just as much as we were! This all changed when the fog rolled in at 1:00pm. First, it took out the south quadrant. Our team held their ground hoping for the best. The fog slowly but surely encased the Hill and our hawkwatchers were surrounded. We remained on the hill for 45 minutes, hoping to wait out the siege, but ultimately surrendered to the fog. <br/><br/>Thank you to our brave and determined hawkwatchers for their hard work and optimism!<br/>

<p>While cloudy morning conditions were promising for a cool day, alas it was not. The sun came out around 11am and it heated up to around 93 degrees Fahrenheit by 12:30pm. The Hawkwatchers called it a day and left the Hill to seek refuge down at 1064. <br/><br/>Despite warm conditions, we did see some raptors! We counted a few Sharp-shinned Hawks, Cooper's Hawk and Kestrels of all flavors. But overall, the raptors were not navigating the Headlands either as there was low raptor activity. We are feeling a little bit like Goldilocks because we only want just the right amount of sun and wind. Perhaps next time! <br/><br/>Stay cool out there!  <br/>

<p>The Sunday 2 team was excited when they arrived in the Marin today because the heavy fog earlier in the morning dissipated and a nice clear day began. We got up to the Hill in time to begin counting at 9:30 but the wind was slow and the hawks even slower.<br/><br/>An adult Redtail was perched on a telephone pole in the south quadrant for almost three hours if that gives any indication to how the skies were looking. Things picked up around noon when we saw the season's first Merlin!<br/><br/>Then the sun began beating down on us and the Hill reached 90 degrees. We retreated at 2:30 due to slow skies and overheated hawkwatchers. <br/><br/>Stay cool out there,<br/>Sunday 2<br/><br/>

Connect with your hawkwatch team and enjoy their presence. Swap bird stories, share some cookies, and bring humor to your present situation.<br/>2. Take a walk around the beautiful (although foggy) Marin Headlands and brush up on your non-raptor bird identification. You might even spot a raptor!<br/>3. Bring a great lunch with lots of snacks because you deserve it, you dedicated volunteer you. <br/>4. If you happen to test the visibility on the Hill on a foggy weekend and luck is on your side, you could see a Hawk Talk or a Raptor Release. Enjoy the beauty of seeing a live raptor in hand and appreciate the raptorial knowledge shared by our docents.<br/>5. Leave the Marin Headlands accepting the present fog, but with thoughts of clear skies.<br/><br/>Hoping for clearer skies in the weeks ahead! <br/><br/>

<p>Hello All!<br/><br/>Seeing as we were fogged out once again, it's time for an edition of  RAPTOR FACT FRIDAY!<br/><br/>1. Some species of raptors, such as Kestrels, are able to see in the UV spectrum! Because of this, they can follow the urine trails of their prey!<br/><br/>2. Bald Eagles are considered scavenging kleptoparasites. This just means that they primarily scavenge or steal their food. Bald Eagles have been seen stealing fish from waterfowl, Osprey, otters, fisherman, and each other!<br/><br/>3. Swainson's Hawks switch to an insectivore diet in their non-breeding season in Argentina, where they will feast upon mostly dragonflies and grasshoppers!<br/><br/>4. If you hear a Bald Eagle in a movie or perhaps the falcon from Mulan, don't be fooled! Hollywood has a habit of using Red-tailed Hawk calls in place of most raptor calls.<br/><br/>5. Hollywood isn't the only one using Red-tailed Hawk calls! Steller's Jays have been heard mimicking Redtail calls as well!<br/><br/>Thanks for tuning in, folks! <br/><br/>Happy hawkwatching!<br/>

<p>Another day under the fog. Another day around the Rodeo Lagoon. Great things were seen. Many Yellowthroats and Song Sparrows tumbled about. Two hawkwatchers spotted a Redtail as it caught a mouse and dove into the bushes to enjoy its meal under the safety of the foliage. It even had a purple color band on its right leg - meaning it was banded by us this season! As we retreated to the office, an Osprey flew over our heads (in full Gull disguise), but someone quickly realized its true identity! We decided to have lunch at the Annex in hopes that the fog would lift... but it did not. Although we saw a young Coop, nothing else was flying under the fog, hinting at us to abandon the fort.<br/><br/>Shout out to the Great Blue Heron in the Lagoon who savored many a fish for lunch today!<br/><br/>Hope we have better luck next cycle and hawkwatch on!<br/>

<p>The radio crackles... It's Step's excited voice exclaiming, "there is a BIG bird over Fort Cronkhite!" The message quickly makes its way around the team, and all binoculars turn towards the Lagoon. Some of the team members spot a large chocolate-y brown bird circling the Marine Mammal Center with its wings spread out very flat. Amid gasps from hawkwatchers with their eyes on the bird, others anxiously ask "Where is it?" as they realize it must be something special. Soon enough, a voice shouts, "It's an eagle! It's a Bald Eagle!" The hawkwatchers soak in a marvelous sight as the second juvenile Bald of the season circles the Lagoon before it disappears into the Bay. <br/><br/>The fun did not stop there! A few minutes later, as the team watched two Redtails around Point Bonita, an Osprey arose in the distance! Around lunch time, when a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk showed off its wing crescents as it flew over our heads, the team got a preview of the weeks to come during peak migration - trying to keep track of the numerous Redtails, Turkey Vultures and novel species that are starting to make their way south for the winter.<br/><br/>Not a shabby day for Tuesday 2 team!<br/>

<p>After shining down on our hawkwatchers for the last couple of days, the sun decided to take a break and hide behind the clouds for the day. Temperatures ranged from the mid-60s to 70 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the day with strong western winds reaching up to 20 miles per hour! To top off the drastic shift in weather, hawkwatchers felt raindrops starting at 1:30 PM with a more steady rainfall at 2:30 PM. <br/><br/>Visibility was low due to hazy skies so we saw more people than hawks today. However, we did manage to spot two female Kestrels buzzing the Hill, two Peregrines hanging out on the bridge, and two Harriers cruising through the valley. Other than that we saw the usual Redtails and Turkey Vultures. <br/><br/>If you plan on visiting the Hill, make sure to bring layers and be prepared for any weather because as the past few days goes to show, it has a mind of its own!<br/><br/>

<p>Howdy readers! <br/><br/>We are happy to report that the hot conditions from previous days have dissipated. Our warmest hour was from 3-4pm at 88 degrees F. A steady breeze from the west kept raptors aloft for most of the day. <br/><br/>With these more favorable conditions, we recorded 247 raptors in all, ranging from our familiar friend, the Turkey Vulture, to two lanky Northern Harrier juveniles. Our most notable sighting was a beautiful, chocolate-brown dark morph Red-tailed Hawk. A juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk was recorded as well! Also, we saw an adult Peregrine Falcon making its way across the hills in front of the north quadrant.<br/><br/>Besides raptors, we spotted a number of Humpback Whales from the Hill. Very thankful for favorable conditions and a full day of data collected! <br/>

<p>What "Fun in the sun with Saturday 1" exclaimed our dayleader Bob Power as we left the Hill for the day.<br/><br/>It was another hot one, with temperatures reaching 100F, causing the team to call it a day by 12:30pm.  We saw the usual suspects circling around - many Redtails, Turkey Vultures, a beautiful female Kestrel, a Coop, and a Harrier! Although the number of raptors surpassed the degrees Farenheight, not many songbirds or people were seen at the Hill. We found them all hanging out by the cool waters of the Pacific Ocean and the Rodeo Lagoon!<br/><br/>Nevertheless, a few people were able to witness our first HawkTalk of the season, led by our own outreach intern, Kaitlin! These will be held every weekend (weather permitting) in September and October at noon followed by a Raptor Release at 1:00pm, so don't miss them! <br/><br/>Don't forget to stay cool and hawkwatch on!<br/>

<p>Fogust is OVER! Hottember is here!<br/><br/>The hawkwatchers embraced a new obstacle today as we were faced by the hottest weather on the Hill yet. The raptors felt the heat too, for they avoided paying us visits throughout the day. We did have some nice sightings though. Early on, we caught sight of an Osprey approaching from the lagoon and then a male Kestrel flashed its colors our way.<br/><br/>Due to some far away Northern fires, it was hazy in all directions - causing our visibility to be very poor. After countless swifts, dragonflies, and butterflies, the heat drove us away from the Hill, and we had to abandon our positions around 1:00pm. <br/><br/>Stay cool out there and have a great Labor Day Weekend, everybody!<br/>

<p>What's black and white and red all over?<br/>...an Osprey with a sunburn!<br/><br/>And we were also sunburnt as temperatures reached a blistering 90 degrees today up at the Hill. The heat must have made the Redtails lay low because it took until 1:00 to see a decent number of them. As much as the hawkwatchers yearned for a Prairie Falcon, there were none in sight. We did, however, catch some great views of Red-shouldered Hawks and a dark morph juvenile Redtail!<br/><br/>Our non-raptor datasheet was filled out pretty nicely with large numbers of Blue-gray Gnatcatchers (sixty-six!!) and all three migrating Swifts (Black, Vaux's, and White-throated). We also honed our dragonfly identification skills today when the raptors were too hot and tired to fly. <br/><br/>Remember your sunscreen and happy Labor Day weekend everyone!<br/><br/>Thursday 1<br/><br/>

<p>Hello readers! <br/><br/>We were greeted by fog at home base, on the annex, and peering up to the Hill. Clearly "Fogust" is not backing down until the last moment. We all know that the fog will totally vacate on September 1! <br/><br/>Although we never made it to the Hill, raptors were flying around the annex viewpoint. We spotted a few adult and juvenile Redtails, a Cooper's Hawk, and Turkey Vultures. We watched a raven couple flop around the annex too. Seeing one crack open a pistachio was a major highlight. It was really cute sight, but not nearly as cute (and awesome!) as seeing the Wednesday 1 Hawkwatch team up counting raptors from the Hill.   <br/><br/>Hoping for better luck next Wednesday 1!<br/>

<h2><a name='20170828'/>Monday, August 28, 2017</h2>
<p>Welcome to the beginning of the second cycle of the season! Monday I was happy to be mostly out of the fog and stretch their legs on the Hill. The day started with clear sky above and fog below with little to no breeze. The wind began to pick up around 12-1 PM from the NW and the birds took flight. Some highlights of the day were two Red-shouldered Hawks, ten Kestrels, and a few Humpback Whales.<br/><br/>But the real excitement happened around 3:15 PM after mostly a slow, sunny day...A raptor emerges through the fog in the West quadrant moving right. All the Hawkwatchers get the bird in their binoculars as a last hurrah. After a good look, someone yells "PRAIRIE FALCON!" and everyone becomes transfixed. Dayleader Keith makes his way through the team after the bird disappears from view making sure everyone got a chance to see it and thankfully, most everyone on the team did! <br/><br/>We also encountered another bit of luck as a visitor of Hawk Hill with a camera was able to get some pictures of the beautiful falcon and send them to us!<br/><br/>Quite a turn-around from the fog last Monday I! <br/>

<p>It was another scorcher up on the Hill today with temperatures reaching into the 80s. Along with the heat came some interesting birds, such as Blue-gray Gnatcatchers and Vaux's Swifts. There was not a breeze in the sky at the beginning of our count and Karl the fog was lying low under the Golden Gate. We didn't even see a single Turkey Vulture the first hour we were there!<br/><br/>As the breeze picked up, more hawks flew into view. We got some spectacular views of accipiters today, including both an adult Coop and Sharpie! We also saw a juvenile Northern Harrier, its pumpkin belly glowing in the sunlight, circle around the quadrants and an Osprey flying over the fog without a worry in the world.<br/><br/>Sunday 2 had a great first day! That's a wrap cycle 1.<br/> <br/>Sunburnt but happy,<br/>Lara<br/><br/>

<p>Afternoon readers! <br/><br/>We have had quite a day on the Hill. It started off as a warm one (reaching 89.5 degrees Fahrenheit!) with little to no breeze. The fog was still alive and well, covering up most of our south quadrant. Due to this, our butterfly and dragonfly counts soared! The raptors were hiding out somewhere else. <br/><br/>Things began to pick up around noon as the hawks finally took to the skies with a little encouraging wind. We saw some notable species including a dozen Black Swifts, adult Sharp-shinned Hawk, adult and juvenile Peregrine, and a close fly-bye by two juvenile Northern Harriers. <br/><br/>It just goes to show a slow day on the Hill can turn around at any moment. Go Saturday 2! <br/>

<p>Hello All!<br/><br/>Another foggy day on the Bay for our hawkwatchers. Though we did not get up to the Hill, we witnessed a trifecta in the sky as a Redtail, Cooper's Hawk, and a Peregrine all flew through our field of vision at once! The rest of the afternoon was spent looking at little birds flitting around the bushes and Redtails joshing around in the distance. The fog came in waves, bringing hope to the hawkwatchers and then crushing it. <br/><br/>Sending sunny vibes to our weekend hawkwatchers!<br/>

<p>Fogust strikes again! On our way to the annex we pulled over to watch an Osprey fly overhead. Upon our arrival, the Wednesday II team was met with plenty of fog and cold winds. We spotted an adult Redtail perched in a eucalyptus and watched its movements most of the day. Turkey Vultures teetered past and the team tested their accipiter ID skills when two Cooper's Hawks sped by. Despite the fog, the adult Redtail and a Raven were able to snatch some yummy looking snakes for lunch. <br/><br/>Hoping to have better luck next cycle!!<br/><br/>-Wednesday II<br/>

<p>Tuesday II takes the cake! Literally, Maureen and dayleader Mary brought us cakes (in many forms and with many thanks!). We achieved the highest Hawkwatch count of the season so far (160 birds!) thanks to the sunny skies on the Hill. Some of our highlights include seeing Northern Harriers, Sharpies, and a couple of Coops. Step spotted our first White-tailed Kite flying oh so mysteriously into the fog hmmm.

<p>How does the moon cut the sun's hair?<br/> ...Eclipse it!<br/><br/>That joke was courtesy of Allen Fish at the Hawkwatch meeting this morning. Here are a few more in case you need more cringe-worthy jokes<br/><br/>How do you organize a solar eclipse party?<br/> ...You planet!<br/><br/>Why didn't the sun go to college?<br/> ...It already had like a million degrees!<br/><br/>Anyway, happy eclipse day everyone! We hope you stayed safe and protected your peepers! Monday II Team went out to the annex (due to fog) decked out in some sweet eclipse shades. Our eye gear became more of a fashion statement as the fog eclipsed the eclipse. We did a loop around the lagoon and watched some Great Blue Herons and Snowy Egrets. The interns also stared at a Pied-billed Grebe for an excessive amount of time before having to catch up with the rest of the team. <br/><br/>Alright, one more joke!<br/><br/>What did the sun say when it reappeared after an eclipse?<br/> ...Pleased to heat you again!<br/><br/>Hopefully the weather heats up and the fog clears out tomorrow for our Tuesday II Hawkwatchers!<br/><br/>

<p>Good afternoon hawkwatch readers and welcome back to the Sunday 1 team! We made our way to the Hill and stopped briefly at the annex to arrange carpools when we saw two adult Peregrines gliding overhead. Too bad we didn't see them when our count started but it was a great sight nonetheless!<br/><br/>When we made it up to the Hill we were greeted by a layer of fog. But after an hour the skies cleared up pretty nicely and Redtails and Turkey Vultures started flying past. There were plenty of visitors up on the Hill today and were able to see juvenile Redtails hovering right in front of the west and north quadrants. The season's first Red-shouldered Hawk, its wing crescents illuminated by the fog, was seen flying over Angel Island.<br/><br/>Thanks to the Sunday 1 team for another good day on the Hill and we're excited for many more to come,<br/><br/>Lara and Danielle <br/><br/>

<p>We were completely fogged out today! However, the day did not end without some excitement first. We walked around the lagoon, where we saw a small orange orb that turned out to be a female Kestrel perched on a tree - hanging out next to a woodpecker. We then followed the Miwok Trail for a while and worked on our Turkey Vulture identification skills.<br/><br/>Later on we made our way to the rifle range, where we shared our best raptor jokes (if you have any good ones, please, please share). As we were munching on our lunches, we spotted a couple of Redtails, one perched on a cypress and another making its way across the valley. The highlight of the day was a visit from a juvenile Cooper's Hawk that stuck around long enough for all of us to get a good look. After watching a coyote eat some moles and many Bluebirds scavenge for insects, we decided to make our way up to Hawk Hill.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, up at the Hill there were not too many birds or people thanks to the fog, so were not able to count anything for the day. However, the team's morale is still high and we can't wait for the coming weeks. 'Til next time, raptor aficionados!<br/>

<p>The past couple of days were met with sunshine and lots of birds, so we hoped for the pattern to continue... but unfortunately, Karl the Fog had other plans. Although the fog was low and persistent, it couldn't keep us away from the Hill! <br/><br/>After getting a good look at some perched Cooper's Hawks and Redtails from the Annex, we headed up to Hawk Hill with high hopes of spotting more. However, after a couple of hours we had only caught a glimpse of some Redtails and Turkey Vultures swirling in the fog. Much fun was had getting to know the team, and we can only hope for better luck in the next coming days!<br/><br/>Happy birding!<br/>

<p>Today was another sunny and, should I say, birdiful day up at Hawk Hill! Based on yesterday's numbers, the Thursday I team was eager to dust off their binoculars and hit the hill. The day started off quickly with two female American Kestrels zooming by the south quadrant and Redtails stilling all around us. <br/><br/>A highlight of the day was a yell from Step to come check out this bird! In our sights was the first Peregrine Falcon of the season! The juvenile falcon was being harassed (or was it doing the harassing?) by two Redtails while we watched with glee. Bob Power managed to excite the interns with a shout of whirly bird, but to everyone else this just meant a helicopter. Good one, Bob!<br/><br/>Overall, Thursday I started the season with a strong first day and with two wonderful new dayleaders, Natasha and Laura. Thanks to our fellow hawkwatchers for a wonderful day. <br/><br/>Keep up the good work,<br/>Ashley and Lara<br/><br/>

<p>The Tuesday 1 Team was thrilled to be reunited for the season and welcomed their new members enthusiastically! Hawk Hill was ominously shrouded in fog, so the team moved to the annex. Two adult Red-tailed Hawks were immediately scoped out perched directly in front of the lookout. Some suspected that the two might be a local mated pair. The fog persisted and both the Redtails and the Hawkwatchers left the hill. Stay tuned, Folks!<br/>

<p>It was a bittersweeet start to the season as we remembered Lewis Cooper, the long-time dayleader of the Monday 1 hawkwatch team.  We watched a short memorial video of Lewis's life and shared stories from over the years. Thank you to Jim H. and Tim B. for coming to remember this great hawkwatcher and celebrate his contribution to the GGRO and beyond. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, we didn't make it to the Hill today due to pesky fog but we braved Conzelman Rd. and fought for a parking spot at the annex. From this view point, we spotted a few redtails and turkey vultures. We hope the sun will shine on the Hill by next Monday 1, but for our fellow hawkwatchers later this week, we hope sooner!<br/><br/>We would like to end this blog post and start the season with a Lewis Cooper original haiku titled "Red-tailed Hawk." To see Lewis orate his haikus on video, please visit this link: </p>

<p>"A Ferrug for you and a Ferrug for you," we sang and danced after the second Ferruginous Hawk was spotted. Both hawks were juveniles, not yet grown into their rufous overtones. Other than the stars of the show, we saw a few Sharpies, Harriers, and the usual Redtails cruising through the Headlands. All birds seen today were just as sweet as the candied bacon and spiced nuts consumed by the cheerful hawkwatchers. The final day of the 2016 GGRO Hawkwatch season brought few, but beautiful, raptors to hold us over 'til next fall.<br/><br/>Happy hawkwatch to all, and to all a good flight! <br/>

<p>It was a sunny and slow Saturday, the second-to-last day of the season. We enjoyed dolmas, lumpia, borscht, pecan cookies, chimichurri chicken skewers, and a couple of dark morph Redtails. The wind was calm, temps ranged from 60-70, and spirits were high. Only ONE more day of hawkwatching left! What will we see???<br/>

<p>Weather on the hill was beautiful and sunny with temperatures in the mid fifties and a light wind. The team started the day with a decent amount of Red-tails for the first hour, along with a Red-shoulder. Then as the wind died, so did activity, and all the hawk watchers dug into the macaroni salad! Eventually the birds picked back up, and a Red-tail in the East turned into a juvenile Swainson's hawk. We were graced with a number of juvenile Harriers late in the day, and just as the team was relaxing in the last half hour, the recorder shouts "Hey what's that?" Another Red-shoulder flew right over the hill followed closely by an adult Cooper's hawk. What a great way to wrap up the season!!<br/>

<p>Weather on the hill today was sunny and comfortable with variable winds out of the North. The team started the day by setting up an elaborate pot luck, complete with lattes and camp stove heated chili. For the first several hours we were graced by Red-tails and vultures with a few Coops sprinkled in. Later we got an Osprey in the north quadrant, an adult male harrier way out in the north, and a juvenile Peregrine making stoops on Hawk blind. Though they did not get the falcon, they did a release study that we identified as a juvenile harrier... cool! Late in the day a flock of 187 White Pelicans was spotted heading north with a Canada goose in formation with them; seemed like a very confused bunch!! Great last day on the hill with the ever prepared Tuesday II team!<br/>

<p>"I've got an Osprey out here!"<br/><br/>Suddenly 16 eyes and 8 binoculars were pointed in the North Quadrant. <br/><br/>"fhwWhere?" Shouted an intern, breathless for the chance to see a bird in late November, but also with a mouth full of food.<br/><br/>"It's under the white house moving left..."<br/><br/>"Wait there's an adult bald eagle out there!"<br/><br/>"WHERE?!" shouted the intern again, food swallowed so her shout was clear across the Hill.<br/><br/>Although this gluttonous intern didn't get to see the bald eagle, she and her team had a lovely day on the Hill, spotting ospreys, a few Redshoulders, a high flying White-tailed Kite, and a handsome hovering male Kestrel.  The usual Redtails and Turkey Vultures could be seen of course, meandering along the hills or stilling above the area. With a steady wind from the Southwest and temperatures between 56-65, the atmosphere was pleasant.<br/><br/>Overall, a great final day for Monday II!<br/><br/>

<p>Highlights from this slow, chilly day were a Peregrine and a Merlin, both of which flew very slowly and close to the hill, giving us good looks at them. The next exciting thing  was the California Scrub Jay that boldly decided to partake in our end-of-season pot luck. Other than that, we mostly counted Redtails and Turkey Vultures. We miss the  accipiters!<br/>

<p>After a whopping 1.5 hours on the Hill, we decided to call it quits. We left just as the rain blew in from the South. In our short time up there, we saw a handful of Redtails, a few Turkey Vultures, and a couple of Peregrines on the Golden Gate.

<p>Today was overcast and cold! The hawk watchers donned every layer they owned, faced into the South East wind and found all the hawks they could! Most of the birds found early on in the day were perched... probably just as cold as we were. It even took the Turkey vultures an hour to get up in the sky. The sun began to show itself towards the end of the day, and it brought a Red-shouldered hawk with it. Pretty slow day on the hill, but it was a prefect way to shiver off all the Thanksgiving food still in our bellies!<br/>

<p>What we are thankful for today:<br/><br/>1. Beautiful sunny days on the Hill (Temperatures today: low 60s, North/Northeast wind).<br/><br/>2. Turkey Vultures and Redtails for helping us learn how to pass birds to other quadrants.<br/><br/>3. Sharp-shinned hawks for their tiny heads and square edged tails.<br/><br/>4. Juvenile Northern Harriers for their festive pumpkin colored undersides and wobbly flight.<br/><br/>5. Red-shouldered Hawks for their flashy crescents and bright clothing.<br/><br/>6. Peregrine Falcons for their speed and their consistency in perching on the Golden Gate Bridge.<br/><br/>7. But mostly, thank you to such a wonderful, positive, and fun Hawkwatch team that came out each week despite the poor weather and identified those flying raptors like champions. <br/><br/>Happy Thanksgiving everyone!<br/>

<p>Although raptor activity is slowing down at this point in the season, we are still seeing some great birds. Today's highlight was a sub-adult Bald Eagle. We watched it power from East to North, trying to get away from some Ravens that were pestering it. This marks the sixth Bald Eagle sighting this season, matching the past ten-year average. Temperatures ranged in the high 50s to low 60s, with winds blowing from the Southwest.  <br/>

<p>We've started the downward spiral into the end of the season and thus sadness has saturated the hearts of all the watchers. Crushed by the impending doom, the Tuesday I team prepared delicious treats which brightened the spirits of each intrepid binocular-wearing volunteer. Temperatures ranged from 58-60 F and winds were blowing from the South ish (S, SE, and SW).<br/><br/>Turkey Vultures and Redtails were our common species today, coming in exactly even in total numbers by 3:30 PM (88 for each species). A few Peregrines coasted by the hill, meandering over the Golden Gate Bridge before zooming off into the distance. One Northern Harrier looked particularly hungry, taking a steep and fast stoop towards something along the ground, but alas, the youngin was unsuccessful.<br/><br/>A great year with Tuesday I, thanks for all the food and the laughs! <br/>

<p>The final two-week cycle of the 2016 Hawkwatch season began today, and the Monday 1 Team finished strong. The highlight of the day was an adult Bald Eagle! The eagle was first spotted in the northwest, and gave the team great looks as it moved south and crossed the Golden Gate. This marks the fifth Bald Eagle counted by GGRO Hawkwatchers this season. <br/><br/>Temperatures today were in the high 50's to low 60's and winds were light from the west. Overall, raptor activity was fairly low, particularly in the second half of the day. Red-tailed Hawks, however, were still passing through in notable numbers. We recorded a total of 95 Redtails, with close to an even split between adults and juveniles.<br/>

<p>Beautiful day on the hill with very still winds! Quite the change from yesterday's blustery count. We had temperatures in the mid sixties and plenty of sun. The day started off interesting with not only a distant Ferruginous hawk, but an adult male Northern Harrier as well... what fantastic spotting! Shortly after we were visited by White-tailed kites (finally!) and two young Red-shouldered hawks. While the East quadrant was working a dark morph Red-tail, everyone else got on a high rough-legged hawk zooming along the coast from West to South. Unfortunately, the day went downhill from there in sightings, but there was an adult Golden eagle and Osprey to encourage us to keep scanning that still, empty blue sky!<br/>

<p>Easy, BREEZY, beautiful... Hawkwatch. <br/><br/>Beanies, scarves, and gloves were donned by the hawkwatch team today, as temps never went above the low 60s and gusty winds blew from the NW and W. We counted Turkey Vultures, Redtails, and a very low number of Accipiters. Four to five of our 50 Redtails took advantage of the wind and spent hours stilling in front of us. A juvenile Peregrine stooped and zoomed for a couple of minutes and we struggled to keep up. Another highlight of the day was a magnificent juvenile Ferruginous Hawk that rose in the north quadrant and quickly made its way over the bay. Not the most exciting day in terms of numbers, but it was full of beautiful, close looks at a variety of raptor species. <br/>

<p>Fog in November?? Just when we thought we had left it all behind in August! Today the team took the morning to walk down to Kirby Cove and enjoyed the smell of wet Eucalyptus trees. We saw both of the resident Kirby Red-tailed hawks preening in the mist and they were totally unperturbed by our presence. Lots of sparrows, pygmy nuthatches, a hairy woodpecker, and hermit thrush were seen as well. But unfortunately the fog did not lift the hill and all the hawk watchers went home for some warm tea!<br/>

<p>Worried we would be socked in by fog all day, the Hawkwatch team took a leisurely stroll across the misty lagoon. But after some frantic radio calls from our helpful banders, we said our farewells to the egrets and herons and made our way up to the Hill. Much to our surprise, it was hot! Temperatures ranged from 65-75F, with little to no wind until the last hour or so from the North/Northwest.<br/><br/>As far as raptors go, it was a bit of slow day. We saw the classics: Redtails, Sharpies, Coops, and Turkey Vultures. There were a few adult accipiters in the mix and some gorgeous adult Redshoulders as well. One exciting happenstance was a minor disagreement between a juvenile and adult female harrier. The adult took a few dive bombs on the juv, in an almost "get off my lawn" type of style. Pesky kids!<br/><br/>Many water crossings were attempted by the raptors, but large bodies of water are scary! Where are the thermals? Many of them were forced to turn back and spend a little more time in the Headlands with us.<br/>

<p>After counting 119 Red-tailed Hawks on the Hill, we came down to our office to find an adult Redtail FEASTING on the flanks of a rabbit at the top of a power pole. It struggled at times to keep itself and its meal from plummeting to the ground. Because we had a warm and somewhat slow day on the Hill, this sighting was a real treat. Other highlights were nine Merlins, nine Harriers, and four dark morph Redtails.<br/>

<p>Today was one for falcons and Ferruginous Hawks! We had good looks at most of the 12 Merlins we spotted, including one hunting for bugs over the Golden Gate Bridge and eating them on the wing. A juvenile Peregrine dove around in front of our north quadrant, giving us quite a show! Around noon, a beautiful adult Ferruginous Hawk appeared down in Rodeo Valley, rising slowly and giving us dorsal and ventral views for a few minutes. We started off with a bit of fog and an east wind, but it cleared up and the wind eventually started blowing from the west. A beautiful day with some lovely birds!<br/>

<p>Thursday I team made it to the hill AGAIN. HA! Take that fog!! We started the day with the second Prairie Falcon of the season, then continued to get Merlins, kestrels, and Peregrine Falcons... the first four falcon day of the season!! An adult Golden eagle was spotted in the west getting dive bombed by a raven. A couple of dark morph Red-tails were seen today, but no Harlan's. Numbers were a little low, but the weather was partly cloudy with temperatures in the high sixties. Lovely day on the hill.<br/>

<p>Conditions in the Marin Headlands were solid for hawkwatching on this November day, with good visibility, a moderate northeast wind, and temperatures in the high 60's to low 70's. Both Red-tailed Hawk and Sharp-shinned Hawk numbers were high, with Redtails outnumbering 123 to 119. Four of these Redtails were dark morphs, including one Harlan's Hawk that provided a great view of its light gray tail with a red tip. The path taken by Sharpies became routine, as individuals rose up in the west quadrant, wrapped around north and made a line for San Francisco to the southeast. <br/>

<p>Due to a lack of wind, a temperature range of 68-74F, a 25th birthday, and the end of a dramatic presidential campaign, the heat was felt on Hawk Hill today. With pie and a Swainson's Hawk on our plate, the Tuesday I team ended the day with full bellies and 10 species on the data sheet.<br/><br/>Our accipiters are still streaming through with a few adults in the late afternoon. There were also several good looks at Harriers as they combed the contours of the surrounding hills. Our "bird of the day" was, of course, a Swainson's Hawk, spotted by an intern. Although her mouth was full of apple pie, luckily for us, the intern was still able to call out a muffled, "Buteo over South Platform!" The back lighting from the sun and the glare of the ocean prevented a diagnosis on age, however it was a Swainson's Hawk nonetheless!<br/><br/><br/>

<p>Weather conditions were pleasant on Hawk Hill today, with temperatures risings from the mid 60's into the low 70's. Winds were light, coming from the east in the morning and switching north by the afternoon. Redtails were moving, including two adult dark morphs. Accipiters tended to pass by high and in small flurries. Overall, activity was highest from 11am to 12pm, during which our total for the hour was 69 raptors. By the mid afternoon, things had slowed down significantly. Due to daylight savings time, at 3:00pm the sun was low in the sky and very few birds of prey were about. <br/>

<p>We had to delay the start of our count to about noon due to fog over Hawk Hill. Temperatures ranged in the low- to mid-60s with light winds blowing from the West. There was not a lot of raptor activity even after the fog cleared from the Hill, but we did our best to change Ravens into Peregrines and Bluebirds into Kestrels (they were uncooperative). The most exciting episode today involved an adult female Northern Harrier feeding on a small bird just downhill from our platform on Hawk Hill. Nature!<br/>

<p>Today's hawkwatch team was hoping for a good variety of species like the last two days, and instead got hit with a mid-day bout of fog. The day started off warm with little wind, but the wind picked up just before 11, bringing much fog with it. We lost most of our visibility, and had an occasional Sharpie fly close in the fog, our most common species of the day. After the fog cleared at 1:20, we saw a good number of Sharpies, Redtails, and a handful of Harriers. Temps remained in the 60s, our spirits remained high, and thankfully the fog did not remain low. <br/>

<p>With a flight like yesterday's, the Friday II team had high expectations for the day... and we were not disappointed. Today was hotter than yesterday (79 degrees Fahrenheit)  with winds from the North dying at about one o'clock. Once the wind was gone we really had to crane our necks to see some fifth quadrant birds. Besides all of the amazing falcons seen today, we saw an adult Bald Eagle high in the sky from the North headed due South. With a scope one of the interns shouted "That eagle has tags on its wings!" Luckily, one of the hawk watchers had a camera, and we hope to find out where this individual came from! Shortly after, there were not one but TWO late season young Broad-winged hawks... had they made it to the headlands yesterday the Thursday II team would have seen all six buteo species. We ended the day with a great look at an adult male harrier of the season. And now we leave you to ponder one of life's greatest questions: If a sharpie is eaten by a peregrine on the hill, do you erase a sharpie from the count?<br/>

<p>The team reached the hill this morning anticipating a hot day... boy were we wrong! The North East winds were gusting up to 18 mile per hour (whoa) with temperatures in the mid 60's. This resulted in a flight of birds appearing in the West quadrant and zooming through to the North... almost following the exact same path, one after the other. We had a fantastic look at a juvenile Rough-legged hawk and an adult female later in the day. A couple of juvenile Ferruginous hawks were nice, and we reached the thirteenth species with a late day Osprey! Today mimicked a "peak" day with our Accipiter numbers, though most of them were adults. Did we forget to mention the Swainson's hawk that hung around for about 15 minutes?? What a great day for Buteos!!<br/>

<p>Today, the Hill was infested with Sharpies and Merlins! A beautiful warm sun prompted heavy sunscreen usage and excellent lighting for our flurry of adult Sharp-shinned Hawks. Wind direction was primarily from the East and Southeast and our temperatures rose from mid 50s to high 60s. <br/><br/>We counted a total of 121 Sharpies with 38 adults presenting slate blue backs. We even had a tricky fast flying adult Sharpie sporting a gorgeous blue blazer...oh wait, that's a Merlin! Including that fellow, we saw 14 Merlins whiz by, a few snacking on dragonflies as they went. Not to be outdone, the Buteo genus threw out a few dark morph juvenile Redtails, which we very much appreciated.<br/>

<p>After multiple days of dreary weather, raptors were again on the move through the Marin Headlands. With 13 different species seen, the Hawkwatchers left Hawk Hill feeling fulfilled. It was a day with many highlights, beginning with an adult Golden Eagle! Two Ferruginous Hawks were seen, including one adult that passed close overhead and exhibited the rufous "V" formed by the legs. Falcon numbers were high, and the team had views of Merlins catching and consuming insect prey. In the early afternoon, shouts from the north quadrant of the Hill about an uncommon raptor stirred excitement. While not everyone got their lenses on the bird, a few members of the team spotted and confirmed a Rough-legged Hawk! For the season, this marks the first Rough-legged seen by Hawkwatch, and the second seen in the Headlands. <br/>

Although some treacherous fog obscured the Hill during the morning hours, by noon we were spotting Redtails and the occasional butterfly. <br/><br/>A slow day, many would declare, however the weather was decent, mid 60s, and a few birds were flying.

There were a few moments of near clearing, only to be followed quickly by another round of dense fog. We didn't count, but down in the valley we saw 3 American Kestrels, 3 Redtails, and a Harrier. <br/><br/>More rain is anticipated to come in tonight and through tomorrow, but if it happens to be clear weather, join us for our final day of docent programs on the Hill.

<p>With storms on the horizon, we had hopes for a few hawks this grand Thursday morning. And such was granted. We were graced by 3 streaky Sharp-shinned juveniles. Our first zipped through the South quadrant and took a desperate flight over the water to disappear by the VA hospital. The next was a distant speck bird that flew over the lagoon and also headed towards the hospital. And our final bird of the day appeared in Kirby cove and made a beeline for the North Tower of the Golden Gate Bridge. Lucky for the little bugger, there were no menacing Peregrines perched along the tower. <br/><br/>A few White-throated swifts were cruising along and a group of Cedar Waxwings was even spotted. However, the storm continued to roll in, and with a final spattering of rain, we called it a day.<br/>

<p>Jumping right into the highlight of the day: an adult Ferruginous Hawk! We all had to do a double-take of this bird because it looked like a juvenile bird from the ventral side--we could hardly make out the rufous "pants" with the sun gleaming behind it. Once the bird generously banked and gave us different angles, there were no doubts about the rust color on the dorsal side. Perhaps it was the change in wind direction from South to West that brought this regal bird to Hawkwatch today. We enjoyed sunny skies and moderate winds, but rain is expected tomorrow. <br/>

<p>Chilly conditions on Hawk Hill today. As the storm moved in, we had temperatures in the high 50's to low 60's and winds from the south reaching up to 25mph. Cloud cover was high, however, making for good visibility. Few raptors were moving, with only 92 birds counted over 5.5 hours. The Hawkwatchers in south quadrant had an exciting spectacle in the middle of the day, as an adult Peregrine Falcon chased an adult Red-tailed Hawk. Overall, it seemed that raptors were hiding out from the approaching inclement weather.<br/>

There were a fair number of Northern Harriers spotted amidst the fog, as well as a couple of Merlins.

<p>Highlights of today's somewhat slow raptor count: a dark morph juvenile Broadwing accompanied by another juvenile Broadwing, good looks at a few Northern Harriers, and an Osprey powering past us towards San Francisco. The day got more clear and less windy as it went on, and temperatures ranged from 65-68. <br/><br/>Temperatures are expected to decrease, and rain is predicted in the next couple of days. We'll see how it affects the birds tomorrow! <br/>

<p>Today was a lovely symphony of fog horns and raptors. The hill was still and sunny, and the hawk watchers were only slightly blinded by the reflection off the fog that hung below the hill. The team was challenged by the lighting; lots of "dark morph" accipiters were recorded, and lots of individuals showed a false orange tint. But with good communication and collaboration, all the birds got the attention and tallies they deserved. A westerly wind picked up later in the afternoon and brought a nice flurry of harriers, a Red-shouldered hawk, an adult Peregrine, mystery kestrel, and two juvenile Ferruginous hawks!<br/>

<p>What a scorcher! Though temperatures never got above 83 degrees Fahrenheit, there was almost no wind and the hawk watchers sure felt it. We made up for yesterday's lack of kestrels, with good looks at a few males throughout the day. An osprey pulled a Houdini act on the team with a brief appearance on the rifle range. There were a couple of adults sprinkled on top of our juvenile accipiter sundae today, and the heat sure did give us some practice with those fifth quadrant birds!  <br/>

<p>Great diversity of species today on Hawk Hill, with comfortable temperatures and good visibility. There were multiple exciting points, starting with two juvenile Ferruginous Hawks that passed through within minutes of each other and were in no hurry to leave. Another highlight moment took place in the early afternoon, when three White-tailed Kites were in a single field of view! Peregrines and Merlins were out and about, but unfortunately no American Kestrel to complete the trifecta. Shortly after 2:30pm, the team was graced with the presence of two Golden Eagles, one juvenile and one subadult! The team was already feeling lucky when, near the end of the day, a distant Swainson's Hawk was spotted! All in a day's work.<br/>

<p>Temperatures today were in the high 60's to low 70's, with intermittent clouds but overall sunny skies. While we only counted eight different species, there were notables such a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk and a couple Merlins. We also saw quite a few Red-shoulders today, including five adults! Beyond raptors, there were large numbers of violet-green swallows capitalizing on the termite eruption that followed weekend rain. <br/>

<p>Having escaped the rain, the Monday II team stumbled upon a mild temperature day (low 60s) with bouts of sun interrupted by some serious fog.  <br/><br/>To jump-start our morning, a leucistic Redtail soared by with an antagonizing Raven snapping at its bold red tail. It had white shoulder pads seen clearly from the dorsal side, but alas, back-lighting obscured the ventral colors from our eyes! Later, we had a blue-grey backed adult Peregrine swoop by the Golden Gate Bridge showing off a rosy breast color. How risque!<br/><br/>However, our day was mostly dominated by swifts, swallows, scrub jays, and phoebes who came to scarf down on the emerging termites. After a good rain, these termites provide an excellent protein source for a variety of birds. From the noises the White-throated swifts were making, I believe it.<br/>

<p>The fog in the early morning lifted minimally, and only to bring progressively heavier precipitation over the Headlands. Showers are predicted for the remainder of the day so we will not be able to count today. If I were a raptor, I would go snuggle up in a nice tree cavity and preen my feathers. Hopefully things clear for tomorrow's Hawkwatch team!<br/>

<p>The Hill was clear at 9 o'clock so we rushed up ourselves and the gear to start the count. Once at the top of the Hill, I thought to myself, "Well, this day could go either way." To the East you could see the city with hopeful rays of sun piercing through the haze. To the West was a gloomy blanket of fog moving over the valley. We turned our backs for 30 seconds to set up a couple scopes and put on our jackets, then turned back around to find the fog had enveloped all four quadrants. Next came a couple large gusts accompanied by mist. This was enough to send us packing our things down the Hill. We were not able to get back up to Hawk Hill today, but we were able to admire a male American Kestrel outside the Visitor Center.   <br/>

<p>On Wednesday, we stared quietly at the weather report forecasting a foggy day for Thursday October 13th, 2016. "Not again," we grumbled. "The Thursday I team doesn't deserve such treatment!" And we shed a few tears and tore out a couple hairs in frustration. But little did we know, there would be a beautiful day waiting for us!<br/><br/>The Thursday I team has continually maintained a great attitude in the face of fogginess, which was bolstered by the chance to finally see some birds on the Hill. We had a lovely day, hitting a total of 313 birds and 10 species. Mixed in the steady numbers of accipiters, were a few adults, boldly flashing grey backs and rufous barred chests. Northern Harriers bopped about the contours of the hills and in the early morning fog a lone Broadwing appeared. That's our first Broadwing of the season! Well, I guess all of these birds are our first of the season...but that's besides the point. <br/><br/>Thank you Thursday I for your steadfast cheerfulness in the face of many fog out days and your excellent birding skills when we finally did get to count.<br/>

<p>Today's team was hopeful that the morning fog would clear, and it really looked like it would, but it did not. We waited and looked for raptors down Conzelman Road, glancing longingly at the top of the hill to see if the clouds would lift. While we waited, we saw many Accipiters, two American Kestrels, a few Redtails, a juvenile Redshoulder, and an adult female Northern Harrier. If only we had gotten to see them from Hawk Hill! <br/><br/>It was misty and chilly, in the low 60s. Tomorrow is supposed to be cloudy, with rain picking up on Friday and possibly over the weekend, so keep an eye out on weather forecast!<br/><br/><br/>

<p>Hawkwatch enjoyed a beautiful 14 species day! Although it was a slow morning, the afternoon boosted our species count. Within just moments of each other, a Peregrine, a Bald Eagle, a Broadwing, a dark morph Redtail, and an American Kestrel appeared in the north! The Bald Eagle was the second recorded on our counts this season, however, this particular bird was a sub-adult. Bald Eagles take five years to reach adult plumage. Because we cannot always identify these raptors to age in their in-between years, we record them as sub-adults at GGRO.  <br/>

<p>Today turned out to be cooler than yesterday, which was a relief for Hawkwatchers. Low fog over Rodeo Beach in the morning receded by noon and winds from the west jump-started our slow morning count. We juggled accipiters throughout the afternoon and were surprised by a couple of low-flying Ferruginous Hawks in the west. There was also a rare sighting of an adult female Northern Harrier that perched on a bush for several minutes. As the Blue Angels jetted overhead, a Peregrine assaulted a Red-tail, ending our count with 11 species. <br/>

<p>There were a plethora of things in the sky today: raptors, Violet-green Swallows, balloon spiders, dragonflies, and lots of flight demonstrations! It was a hot SF Fleet Week day with temps ranging from 77-86 and Blue Angels loudly flying past the hill before flipping and looping over the bay. <br/><br/>Raptor highlights were a high number of Northern Harriers (14) and an increase in adult Accipiters (9 Sharpies and 6 Coops)! Some of the Accipiters were difficult to age because of the low, pink light cast by the autumn sun. Later in the afternoon we had 4 juvenile Broadwings and an adult Golden Eagle. <br/><br/>It was toasty, but fun! Tomorrow should be another good, hot day as well. Just a reminder, we have no Hawk Talk and Raptor Release tomorrow because of Fleet Week. We will resume docent programs on Oct 15.<br/>

<p>Hawk watching 101: A beginner's guide to Friday II<br/><br/>Step 1: Preparation<br/>First thing you're going to want is lots of food, water, and sunscreen. Make sure it's more than just one bottle of water, more than SPF 30, and be prepared to share your lunch with the yellow jackets!<br/>Did I mention bringing binoculars? Those will be handy, too.<br/><br/>Step 2: Mental Alertness<br/>Once on the hill the birds will have no mercy. From the minute you get there until you finish the count they will be on a mission, so don't get distracted by that Golden Eagle for too long... or that Ferruginous. Make sure to take a break every once in a whi- HOLY COW DID YOU JUST SEE THAT PEREGRINE STOOP?? <br/>Anyways, try to stay focused on your quadrant so you don't miss anyth- What's that? There's a kite in my quadrant? OK thanks for telling me West quadrant! Geez.<br/><br/>Step 3: Remember Why You Came<br/>Even though your feet will hurt, and your eyes will get tired, and you might get frustrated as you become an expert at hawk ID; take time to stop. Put your binoculars down and look up as five Accipiters ride a thermal above you. Then look down at all the wonderful people by your side teaching and being taught as you all work together to collect data that will change the way we look at raptor life history for decades to come!<br/><br/>This is why we hawk watch, and this is why we- BROAD WING OVER THE SOUTH PLATFORM!!!<br/>

<p>What a beautiful day to count some hawks! The Thursday II team definitely worked on their tans today and got an excellent show from the Blue Angels. Oh right... birds! The most exciting birds of the day were the adult Red-shouldered hawk, a Merlin who gave us a nice long look as it hunted dragonflies, a Golden Eagle that perched on Slacker Hill before getting bombarded by ravens, and last but not least the lone Ferruginous hawk getting dive-bombed by a Cooper's hawk! All in all, a good day for the team as the Accipiters slow down and the Eagles show up.<br/>

<p>Today, was pretty standard...<br/><br/>Oh wait a second, 2 Golden Eagles? One juvenile and one sub-adult to be precise! We got a great look at the juvenile, what with its three points of light, and a very clean black and white tail. The sub-adult was identified after a run-in with a Redtail, and by a messy tail and clearly molting flight feathers.<br/><br/>Also, we had close looks at an adult Peregrine, fierce and pointy as ever, as well as some juvenile Broadwings, muted colors and crow-sized.<br/><br/>Weather was sunny with a small breeze from the North and Northwest.

A White-tailed Kite appeared to be on a mission today, moving quickly past Hawk Hill and toward San Francisco. Another uncommon sighting was an adult female Northern Harrier, seen hunting low in the Headlands.

<p>GGRO Hawkwatch was more like warbler-watch this morning as we waited for the fog to clear over Hawk Hill. There have been sightings of a Blackpoll Warbler near the Marin Headlands Visitor Center over the past couple of days, but we didn't have any luck. Around 11am, we ventured up to Hawk Hill to find it still completely engulfed in fog. A sudden break in the fog at 12:30pm gave way to beautiful sunny skies and gusts from the North. Although our raptor count didn't last long, we had an 8 species day, including an adult Peregrine and a close juvenile Broadwing. Other than that, the accipiters were making their rounds through each quadrant. <br/>

<p>What is that soaring o'er the radar tower?<br/>Large, broad wings during the 11 o'clock hour.<br/>No white... Gold nape. Oh, how regal!<br/>Look everybody, an adult Golden Eagle!!!<br/><br/>That's right, an adult Golden Eagle was a highlight of the day. We also spotted an adult female Harrier, which we see few of each season. The day was sunny, with temperatures ranging from 65 to 71, and winds were light. Rain is in the forecast for Sunday or Monday, so who knows what the raptor count will be like in the next few days. <br/>

<p>Friday I has done it again! We started the day with an  adult Red-shouldered hawk and a Broad-winged hawk. We ended up counting an Osprey, a White-tailed kite, a juvenile Northern harrier, a Ferruginous hawk, and eight Merlins. Another 13 species day ain't no thing for this team, with Kim as our fearless leader, all hawks are possible!!<br/>

<p>Blast! The fog has cursed us again. The Thursday I team has yet to embrace the season with a solid day of hawk watching. Although we did spend a very informative morning puzzling over dark morph pictures and admiring regal Ferruginous photos. Praying for a shift in weather, we climbed the mystical Hill, swathed in fog. While no such change occurred before the 1PM cut-off time, we saw a few accipiters blow by in the gusty wind as well as some adult Redtails chasing after one another. As always the soup was delicious and the company very appreciated. <br/>

<p>After a hot Monday Hawkwatch, we ascended the Hill to find a fog inversion brewing. Although beautiful to watch unfold, the fog layer made Sharpie spotting particularly difficult as the little accipiters popped in and out of the fog like spastic little dancers. A couple of Ospreys passed by, as well as a White-tailed Kite and a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk. A few Broadwings are still cruising around the Hill so you better get out here fast!<br/>

<p>It was a sweltering day on Hawk Hill. Sunscreen was a must, and a cooler filed with extra water was brought up in preparation for the heat. Temperatures reached into the 90's by noon and winds were very light from the east. The team called it a day at 2pm. <br/><br/>There weren't a lot of raptors moving, however a variety of species were seen. To start the day, we had a great look at an adult Peregrine Falcon as it rose out of Kirby Cove. Also near Kirby Cove, we watched a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk and a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk chase one another. At one point in the day, a Broad-winged Hawk soared close over the Hill. It was identified as a juvenile due to the lack of a thick white tail band and dark trailing edge of the wing. <br/>

<p>As predicted, today was HOT. The wind was gusty when we arrived to the Hill this morning, but it died down as the heat rose. The temperature reached 90 degrees by 2pm. Highlights of the fairly slow day were a male Northern Harrier, good looks at some juvenile Harriers, and one Broadwing that flew close over our heads. We also had a beautiful dark morph juvenile Redtail soaring over the bay, and were fortunate to have an adult female Coopers Hawk for the banding docent demonstration. Warm weather is expected for tomorrow as well, but hopefully the birds will still be flying.  <br/>

<p>It was another warm, beautiful Saturday up on Hawk Hill. Winds were low, so the raptor flow was a little slower than yesterday. Despite the slowness, we were excited to see 2 White-tailed Kites, 12 Broad-winged Hawks, and 2 dark morph Redtails. Lots of Sharpies and Coops flapped their way overhead, as was expected. We're anticipating even more heat tomorrow, but we're hoping for some exciting species to show up in the Headlands. We'll see!<br/>

<p>What a stellar first day on the hill for Friday II! Everyone applied multiple layers of sunscreen and eventually the wind cooperated and came from the Northwest. We not only saw over four hundred birds, but counted the first White-tailed kites and Golden eagle of the season! Step and a local Red-tail started yelling about a Turkey Vulture in the north, but lo and behold it was no vulture... it was an eagle! We had a 13 species day and scanning the west for a last minute Ferruginous hawk that would get us to 14 species, a bobcat was spotted. Thanks for a great day Friday II team!<br/>

<p>The Thursday II team FINALLY made it to the hill! We had amazing weather, but not as many birds as we expected during peak. We did see some great birds though; the highlights being seven Peregrine falcons, two Northern harriers, two Merlins, and two short-eared owls! We also got to see some bird-on-bird action with accipiters dive-bombing Peregrines, Peregrines dive-bombing red-tails, and even the local red-tails performing territorial displays. Today also had a nice amount of Monarch butterflies going past the hill. Way to go Thursday II!<br/>

<p>Today was chillier than expected, with some high cloud cover and wind from the west. Just after we set up on the hill, we immediately got a close look at a juvenile Broad-winged Hawk. The flow of raptors (especially accipiters) wasn't as intense as it was earlier this week, but we had 11 Broadwings and 4 beautiful Ferruginous Hawk sightings that kept us well-pleased. An Osprey also flew directly overhead with a fish ("I'll take that to-go, please!") and a dark morph adult Redtail made an appearance. <br/>

<p>We approached the hill with caution. The rumors of sweltering heat from the day before prompted the lugging of bulky water containers and extra sunscreen bottles. However, Wednesday II was in luck. At tops, the temperature hit 86F, which was further soothed by a comforting breeze.<br/><br/>Like the temperature, our count was lower than yesterday, however still substantial. It was a great day for Sharp-shinned hawks, as we  got to see 156 little ladies and fellas bounce by in the light wind. There were 53 Broadwings milling about in kettles, mostly far from the Hill. Although slightly straining for our lens-aided eyes, it was lovely to see those crow-sized Buteos rising off the thermals and passing through this place. <br/><br/>Thanks to all the extra eyes, scopes, and binoculars out there who helped out our small Wednesday II team.<br/><br/>

<p>Today was so hot, it would have been nice to slip away to the coast...Oh wait! We are on the coast! Today was very sunny with low winds, making for a very warm day on the Hill. For a moment, I thought I was back at home in the Central Valley. Our team did their best to stay hydrated and cool, but the heat got the best of the team by 1:30pm. While most of the team headed home, a handful of determined hawkwatchers stuck out the last two hours of counting. It was another great Broadwing day and a Ferrug even stopped by in the afternoon. At 3:30pm closing time, a female Kestrel glided by to be the final bird on the count and remind us that our extra efforts were worth the heat.<br/>

<p>Broadwings galore! Within seconds of setting up on the Hill this morning we were counting a kettle of Broad-winged Hawks. We were all very excited to see these migrants from various angles and distances. It was also another great day for accipiters, particularly Sharpies. Now is an excellent time to get up to Hawk Hill and brush up those accipiter ID skills! Hope to have another clear day of hawkwatching tomorrow (and maybe even more species)!<br/>

<p>It was a Sharpie, Sharpie, Broadwing kind of a day! We began our count around 11am after the fog cleared, and the Sharpies never stopped popping up in front of our faces. The accipiters have started to pile in; we counted 209 Sharpies and 87 Coops. In the mix were 11 Broad-winged Hawks, some of them wonderfully close to the top of the hill. Other notables were 2 Ferruginous, 5 Northern Harriers, 9 Redshoulders, and 3 Merlins. We broke 550 sightings, and the Sharpies continued to pop up in front of us, even after we closed the count. The floodgates have opened!! <br/>

<p>After yesterday's successful hawk-filled day, the Fog Gods growled with jealousy. As a consequence, the oozing white clouds poured into the Marin Headlands with a swift and angry force. Poor Thursday I team, we didn't stand a chance. However, a brisk walk around the lagoon and a Pectoral Sandpiper convinced us to pop up to Conzelman Road for some raptor viewing. Lucky for us, 9 different species soared by! This included: several Merlins, Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks, Peregrine Falcons, American Kestrels, Red-tailed Hawks, an Osprey, a Northern Harrier, and, of course, many Turkey Vultures.<br/>

<p>Apologies for the delayed post! We had some server issues yesterday.<br/><br/>It was an awesome day for the Wednesday 1 team. With temperatures in the low 70's and a light breeze from the west, conditions were great for watching raptors. A total of 77 Sharp-shinned and 41 Cooper's Hawks passed through, so the team had plenty of opportunities to practice accipiter identification. Many of the accipiters were flying high overhead, causing the Hawkwatchers to develop achy necks as they aimed their binoculars directly above. Such discomfort was quickly forgotten, however, as birds continued moving through in good numbers. A total of 10 Northern Harriers were seen, including an adult female and a juvenile in the same frame. There were also 8 Merlins and 1 Ferruginous Hawk!<br/>

<p>Hawkwatchers got back on the Hill for a full day of counting after several days of fog. Winds were low, the sun was shining, and 11 species were documented. The first Broad-winged Hawk of the season made its appearance high in the clouds over Angel Island and crossed the bay before going completely out of view. A beautiful bird that did not make the count today, but was seen just as we loaded in our cars this afternoon was a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk. We'll get it next time!<br/>

<p>When the Monday 1 team arrived on Hawk Hill this morning, there was cloud cover overhead but decent visibility. Unfortunately, the hawkwatching conditions quickly deteriorated. A thick blanket of fog rolled in from the west, causing the team to call it a day around noon. Although the team was only out for two hours, seven different raptor species were observed. A highlight bird was a juvenile Red-Shouldered Hawk, which showed all the Hawkwatchers its wing crescents as it soared into the dense fog. <br/>

<p>Another fogged out day. We took a walk around Rodeo Lagoon and saw a few exciting non-raptor species: a Spotted Sandpiper, a Red-necked Phalarope, Yellow Warblers, and Common Yellowthroats. The fog never cleared on Hawk Hill, but we traveled up anyway to engage any visitors and watch our banding docent release a magnificent male American Kestrel. Just a reminder, Hawk Talks are held on clear weekends from noon to 1pm in September and October. Following Hawk Talks, a banding docent will release a live raptor and be available for questions. Hope to see you on the Hill!<br/>

<p>Once upon a time there were two interns. They started their season with high hopes of raptors cruising across Hawk Hill. But their days were darkened by the ever oppressive fog. Try as they might, the interns' attempts to get to the hill were thwarted time and time again by the evil fog! But they knew that somewhere out there, the birds were flying. And when that fog-less day arrives, the two interns will watch hawks to their hearts' content and live happily ever after.<br/>

Not a full count today, but great practice keeping track of Red-tails and Turkey Vultures as they moved in and out of the fog around the hill. We saw a few Cooper's hawks on Conzelman while waiting for the fog to clear, but they never popped up once the count officially started... those sneaky Accipiters!! There are sunny days ahead for Thursday II and many birds to come... These are some dedicated hawk watchers!<br/>

<p>This Wednesday Hawkwatch team brought the heat. Quite literally. Slathering sunscreen and sporting fashionable brimmed hats, the Wednesday II crew scanned the skies while the temperature increased, hitting 95F around 1 pm.<br/><br/>The morning was bountiful for dragonflies. While hawks seemed to be lacking, Blue-eyed Darners, Green Darners, Black Sadddlebags, and Variegated Meadowhawks zoomed around Hawk Hill. But as the day wore on, Redtails and Turkey Vultures appeared. A few Coops powered through, giving the hawk watchers a run for their money, and a female American Kestrel even showed us her tiger stripe tail. An Osprey made the list and a tiny buteo from far away revealed wing crescents (among other clues) and became our Red-shouldered Juvenile. <br/><br/>Therefore, another productive but sweaty day on Hawk Hill has passed. <br/>

<p>Sorry for the technical difficulties, folks! Yesterday was one of the warmest days on the hill yet; we got up to 80 degrees. Our highlights were the Osprey, early morning Red-shouldered hawks, and of course the lone Ferruginous hawk. The team got practice in identifying Sharpies and Coops, as well as telling male and female kestrels apart as they hover and zip by. We also kept track of the insects and passerine species on the hill. There were a number of blue-grey gnatcatchers, 2 Say's phoebes, and a mix of Vaux's and black swifts. We counted six species of dragonfly and four species of butterfly moving through... what a great day!<br/>

<p>I think today we could finally say with confidence that raptor migration is happening in the Headlands! We had a really great hawkwatch crew today and a variety of raptors to accompany us. We saw 11 species, including the first Merlin of the season and a fantastically white Ferruginous Hawk! Our American Kestrel count was the highest so far this season at 19 sightings. On our non-raptor count, the most exciting species were Violet-green Swallows and Black Swifts. Visibility and temperatures were great all day. Can't wait to get back on the Hill tomorrow!<br/>

<p>We were anticipating another exciting day of hawk watching, but the fickle weather decided otherwise. We counted for 3.5 hours as the fog danced between leaving and staying. After nearly an hour of only Turkey Vultures and 1 Redtail, a pair of bright American Kestrels flitted past. A few Osprey sightings broke up the slow count of mostly Redtails and TVs after that. The fog looked like it would break, but it ended up coming in thicker with a strong, gusty wind. The team called it quits at 1:30. Isn't Fogust supposed to end when September begins? We'll see what happens tomorrow!<br/>

<p>What a great day it was to be out on Hawk Hill! The weather was perfect and the hawks were flying. We had a big team today and counted the most birds this season so far: 229. Around noon we got a very exciting bird: Ferruginous Hawk!! We almost had a four falcon day; we had the first Prairie Falcon of the season hunting down on the northwest side of the hill!! Unfortunately the Merlins have not arrived yet, but we're ready when they are. Not 30 minutes after the Prairie Falcon, ANOTHER Ferruginous Hawk made an appearance. Looks like the birds are loving the lack of fog as much as we are!<br/>

<p>As we add another tally to the season's list of fogged-out days, I'm beginning to think that it's something I've said. Did I create this abundance of foggy days through my optimistic Hawk Hill dreams? Did I perhaps admire the mystery and the beauty of the fog as it crept over the land a little too much?<br/><br/>Despite these musings about the nature of fog, the Thursday I crew trekked around on a few of the trails around the Headlands. We spotted some Redtails, a Turkey Vulture or two, and even a female American Kestrel. Additionally, we saw an assortment of towhees, finches, and a surprise Belted Kingfisher by the lagoon.<br/><br/>Tonight, I'll dream of fog, and maybe that will appease its fickle nature.<br/>

<p>With 187 birds and 9 different species seen, it was a solid first day on the Hill for the Wednesday 1 team this season. Just after starting time, we were impressed by the agility of a Northern Harrier as it interacted with a Cooper's Hawk that came a bit too close for comfort. As the wind picked up in the afternoon, our Accipiter identification skills were put to the test. We found a useful distinguishing trait to be the ability of Cooper's Hawk to remain more steady in flight than a Sharp-Shinned Hawk. Late in the day, two juvenile peregrine falcon flybys kept the team engaged and excited!  <br/>

<p>It was a beautiful sunny day on the Hill. A few accipiters flew over today and it was entertaining to listen to experienced hawkwatchers argue over their species. Everyone got a different angle on the accipiters, which makes ID tricky. The one Cooper's Hawk today showed me its classic, elongated Coop shape by flying directly overhead. For others, all they saw were the Coop's unsteady flapping and pushed-forward "wrists," appearing Sharpie-like instead. The great accipiter debate will go on throughout the season, but these friendly arguments are always welcome on Hawk Hill. Thanks for reading and happy hawkwatching!<br/>

<p>Second day in a row of great visibility from Hawk Hill! Early on, the Monday 1 team watched a juvenile Bald Eagle soar effortless among a few Turkey Vultures. This spectacle set the tone for a great day, during which a total of ten different species were recorded. Red-shouldered Hawks were spotted for the first time this season, and a considerable number of Osprey were seen. Activity seemed to slow in the mid-afternoon as the winds picked up, but skies remained clear. We look forward to more exciting days as September quickly approaches.   <br/>

<p>Today was a 9-species day on Hawk Hill! Within the first 45 minutes we deviated from our usual Redtails and Turkey Vultures with our first Northern Harrier of the season. We saw more Cooper's Hawks than the last few days and finally spotted a couple of Sharpies. The real treat of the day happened around 1pm when somebody loudly exclaimed "SWAINSON'S HAWK!!!" We identified the Swainie as a dark morph juvenile and were overjoyed at the uncommon sighting for the Marin Headlands. It was an exciting, sunny day for the hawkwatchers!<br/>

<p>Hooray for a clear day on Hawk Hill! We had high fog all day, giving hawkwatchers a complete 360 degree view from the Hill. There was a steady count of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures throughout the day, but an Osprey, a Peregrine Falcon, and a Cooper's Hawk were also seen. Among the 45 juvenile Red-tailed Hawks counted today, one was a dark morph! During the slow moments of the day, we shared chocolate and identified 6 American Lady butterflies in the bushes. It was great to have a full day of hawkwatching!<br/>

<p>"Finally!" I gasped as I reached the summit of Hawk Hill. Having been plagued by multiple days of white-out fog, my little intern heart soared at the chance to see some hawks. Today was my first official day of counting. <br/><br/>The fog continued to obscure many (if not most) of the landmarks and certain quadrants were less than ideal, however, Friday II managed to see not one, not two, but ten Turkey Vultures. We passed them back and forth a few times, giving our voices a chance to practice the Hill's volume control. It was a very special day for us all, finishing with a 50th birthday celebration!<br/><br/>

<p>Twas another foggy day on Hawk Hill. However, after an invigorating Raptor ID quiz, the hawkwatchers were galvanized to head to Conzelman Road. While Turkey Vultures wobbled their way across the sky, many sets of skilled eyes spotted a few Redtails. One adult Redtail even perched on a nearby rock, giving the avid watchers something to point their scope at. The highlight of the day was seeing a lone accipiter flap/glide across the landscape. A Cooper's Hawk was the general consensus. Although the sun peeked through the fog below, the Hill continued to be lost in white. Hopefully tomorrow will be luckier, but the Wednesday II crew still had a good day watching raptors!<br/>

<p>Our day started with a welcome from a red-tailed hawk stilling over the path up the hill. The whole team stopped and watched the local red-tail hovering into the wind for about five minutes... we didn't realize that was a good omen for the day! We saw plenty of red-tailed hawks today, and, of course, a good amount of turkey vultures. Our highlights were the peregrine falcon on the Golden Gate Bridge and a juvenile Cooper's hawk perched on the hill. The fog came back to show us who's boss around three, so we ended the day a few minutes early... 12 raptors per hour and good visibility for Tuesday 2!<br/>

<p>Today's Hawkwatch was cancelled once again due to--you guessed it--fog. However, we took our small team up to Hawk Hill to get a feel for the quadrant system. We also enjoyed lunch amidst the fog, getting to know one another, and even identifying a couple juvenile Red-tailed hawks floating around. With two new hawkwatchers on the team, I think the most valuable discussion we had today was not to feel insecure about your individual hawk ID skills. The important thing is that everyone is doing their part to spot raptors, get help from experienced hawkwatchers, and contribute to the overall accuracy of GGRO Hawkwatch data.<br/>

<p>After a long, foggy first week, the Hawkwatch team was finally able to count some raptors!!! We counted from 11:15am to 3pm, and had a total of 69 sightings. As the fog rolled in and out, we saw mostly Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures, with a couple of American Kestrels and Peregrine Falcons in the mix. Towards the end, 28mph winds were blowing the fog back into our faces, so we left the hill half an hour early. It was great to break the fog streak and finally count some hawks from Hawk Hill!<br/>

Around 1pm, we drove down to the old rifle range on Bunker Road and spotted a juvenile Cooper's hawk, two turkey vultures and quite a few adult red-tailed hawks stilling in the wind.

<p>Welcome to the 2016 fall migration season at the GGRO! Overcast skies on the first day allowed for the Monday 1 team to take its time getting up to Hawk Hill. After an informative meeting with GGRO staff and a quick raptor ID quiz, the team headed to the Annex.  A slight break in the fog prompted the optimistic Hawkwatchers to quickly leave the Annex for the Hill. Over the period of an hour, we counted three Turkey Vultures and two Red-Tailed Hawks. Aging of the Red-Tailed Hawks proved difficult due to the foggy conditions. While it was a relatively slow first day, the Monday 1 Hawkwatchers felt fortunate to be spending their day in the Headlands with fellow wildlife enthusiasts.

<p>For a frigid day on the Hill, with temperatures in the low- to mid-50s, an 8 mph east wind, and steely clouds, it was a pretty good hawk watch. Saturday II redeemed themselves in their last outing, logging two hovering American Kestrels and two close-soaring juvenile Ferruginous Hawks to make up for earlier fog out days. A highlight of the day included looks at a juvenile Northern Harrier, a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk, and an adult Red-tailed Hawk all in a single binocular field. These good views, alongside an impressive feast, made for a thoroughly enjoyable last day of the season.<br/><br/>BEYOND BIRDING: Lots of chilly minutes standing in our respective quadrants left us time for history lessons in the geology of the Bay. Did you know that the Bay as we know it is only tens of thousands of years old? Prior to being flooded at the end of the last ice age, Native Americans walked all the way to the Farallones, about 30 miles away. <br/> <br/><br/>

<p>Although the numbers were low, spirits were high and the birds put on a good show for the final Friday II Hawkwatch. We enjoyed our potluck while being entertained by close flying adult Peregrine Falcons, abundant adult Red-tailed Hawks, and one sub-adult Bald Eagle! The eagle flew right over us with a raven in hot pursuit, allowing us to get a look at its very ragged-looking molt. Weather was very pleasant with light winds and temperatures in the low 60's, making it a lovely day for human and canine Hawkwatchers alike. <br/>

<p>A great last day for the Wednesday II team was punctuated by ONE Peregrine Falcon, ONE Northern Harrier, and ONE American Kestrel. Home-made goodies helped us stave off the cold on this somewhat slow hawk watch. Thanks for a great year, Wednesday II!<br/>

<p>The Tuesday II team's Hawkwatch began with much anticipation for a final day feast on top of the hill. However, we didn't anticipate the day starting off with a very close female adult Peregrine Falcon greeting us as we began setting up. She was soon joined by another adult, and the pair (likely the Kirby Cove residents) defended their turf against intruders, including a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk and a migrating adult Peregrine Falcon. Between munching on chili, salad, homemade hummus, lemon bars, and our Rough-legged award-winning pizza, we spotted three juvenile Ferruginous Hawks and an extremely dark morph adult Red-tailed Hawk. Our season finished dramatically as a juvenile Bald Eagle appeared at 3:32, just two minutes late to be included in the official count. It was nevertheless an exciting finale for the last day on the hill.<br/><br/>Today, temperatures were consistently in the 50's, with moderate winds fluctuating between the north and east. <br/><br/>

<p>The day began with light rain, and cloudy cold weather persisted throughout Monday II's final Hawkwatch. We kept warm with hot chocolate and coffee along with a bounty of homemade treats. While the winds blew predominantly from the north and northwest, they did not carry many migrating raptors our way. We mostly counted Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks, but did get some very nice looks at adult Peregrine Falcons flying right above the Hill. We were especially entertained by the antics of Hawk Hill's resident Ravens, White-crowned Sparrows, and Wrentit as they tried to sneak up to our potluck spread and steal crumbs. We left the Hill at 1:00 once the rain began again and the flow of birds seemed to have completely dried up. While Monday II's season went out with a fizzle in the drizzle, we enjoyed each other's company and our tasty snacks and look forward to reuniting at the banquet in January!<br/>

<p>The entertainment came in waves today, as did the birds. We started the day off right with an adult Peregrine Falcon circling over the platform. Raptor number climbed steadily throughout the day, peaking in the early afternoon. Today, the Common Ravens were fiercely defending their territory harassing a sub-adult Golden Eagle from low in Kirby Cove all the way to Mount Tamalpais. They also relentlessly pursued a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk that hid in the bushes in the south quadrant for five minutes before booking it across the San Francisco Bay. On the non-bird front, a large wedding party and a large choir induced traffic jams on the Hill and in the parking lot. The Hawkwatchers kept warm by munching on cheese and crackers and drinking coffee as the temperatures ranged from the high- 40s to low-50s. Sunday I is thankful for another great season!<br/>

<p>The Saturday I team ended their season strong! Gusts of frigid wind from the East kept Hawk Hill a consistent 50 degrees, but provided for excellent visibility throughout the day. Enduring this extremely chilly weather earned great looks at adult Peregrine Falcons, most soaring around and above the Hill for several minutes and a pair diving repeatedly at an adult Red-tailed Hawk.  Buteos were also out and about despite the strong winds, and we sighted a handful of gorgeous dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks in addition to a most interesting raptor that we all wished had come closer: an adult rufous-morph Ferruginous Hawk. Saturday I was grateful to have such a lovely last day among incredible raptors and looks forward to next year!<br/>

<p>What a glorious ending to the Hawkwatch season for Friday I! The day started out with strong winds and temperatures in the high 40s, but the birds did not take fright. Early in the 10 o'clock hour, Hawkwatchers were surprised to see a very late season Osprey over Wolfback Ridge. This sighting lifted our spirits as the frigid winds froze us to the bone.  However, the Osprey was not the most exciting bird of the day. At around 10:45am, a scream boomed from the East, I think everyone needs to look up! Holly's call caused everyone to turn around and see the pointy accipitrine wings and the long tail of a Northern Goshawk soaring right above the east quadrant. As the day continued temperatures went up and the wind died down and we were blessed with three Ferruginous Hawks, including one adult, eight Peregrine Falcons and another Osprey. Along with great hawk sightings, 445 visitors joined us on the Hill today(that's 74.2 people per hour)! All in all, today's the count was not extremely high, but it was definitely one of the most memorable this year! We certainly have a lot to be thankful for on Friday I. <br/>

<p>Our lovely Thanksgiving Hawkwatch started off blustery and cold, with temperatures in the low-50s and high 40s. The chilly winds blew predominantly from the north, with shifts between northwest and northeast. We began the day right with a close-up sighting of a White-Tailed Kite. Although the usual suspects showed up in lower numbers (Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and Accipiters), we had enough variety to keep us interested, including three long, luxurious looks at Ferruginous Hawks. Add Ann's delicious pumpkin pie, along with a variety of other tasty treats, into the mix, and we couldn't have asked for a nicer Thanksgiving!<br/>

<p>Today was a good full day (no rain-out) with clear views for our final Hawkwatch! The weather alternated between cold and fairly warm with temperatures in the mid-50's and winds from several directions. We saw several Peregrines, including one that went after a Ferruginous Hawk. The thrill of the day was seeing a juvenile Northern Goshawk released by Hawk blind!<br/><br/>GGRO Goshawk Fact: This is only the 6th goshawk that has been banded in the history of the program! Banders and Hawkwatchers alike were delighted to experience this rare visitor to the Headlands.<br/>

<p>Our last day with Tuesday I had an auspicious beginning, with a delightful potluck held in 1064's big room which kept us out of the rain. Today's temperatures remained in the mid-50s throughout the day. The winds on the Hill did not prove quite as cold or harsh as we feared and brought us some excellent looks at Peregrine Falcons and truly spectacular looks at our trusty Red-tailed Hawks, including George who was close enough for us to read his expression through the scope. But the bird of the day was a Prairie Falcon which popped up in the west to demonstrate its hover hunting skills before zooming off. A great way to end our season!<br/>

<p>The Monday I fog curse endured for our final Hawkwatch day of the season. While we never got to official Hawkwatching, we still made the most of our last day. We started off in the GGRO office with a cool presentation by Allen about Harlan's Hawks. Afterward we went to Rodeo Lagoon to do some birdwatching: we saw lots of American Wigeons with a few Eurasian Wigeons mixed in, as well as Northern Shovelers, Goldeneyes, a few grebe species, a Bufflehead, and a Wilson's Snipe. Next we went on a walk on the Miwok trail, where we saw several Red-tailed Hawks, a female American Kestrel, and some more waterfowl. After waiting in the cold fog at the Annex and hoping the Hill would clear off, we ended up hiking up the hill one last time to warm up with some exercise and enjoy a potluck to celebrate our Monday I team. We warmed up with hot chili, pizza bread, salad, and delicious baked goods, including pumpkin pie. Thanks for a great season, everyone!<br/>

<p>It was a beautiful and clear day with high clouds and moderate wind. Due to the previous day's count, the team was psyched to scan for hawks. Though today's count was not as hefty, we made up for it with great company and incredible mammalian sightings. Multiple porpoises swam though the Golden Gate, three whales were spotted beyond Point Bonita, and large flocks of Homo sapien touristi were seen on the summit of Hawk Hill. Throughout the day, many Red-tailed Hawks flew extremely close to the Hawkwatchers. When the day's count started to dwindle at 2:00, a Ferruginous Hawk surprised us in the North Quadrant. Although Thanksgiving is this Thursday, the Sunday II team is looking forward to a delicious banquet on our and GGRO's last Hawkwatch day of the season.<br/>

<p>We were surprised to step out of our cars on the way to the Hill this morning and to nearly be blown over! Despite balmy breezes at 1064, we found ourselves in 15 to 20 mph winds until the early afternoon, after which they calmed. Fortunately, temperatures were consistently in the mid-60s, which kept us comfortable. Overall, the conditions may have helped us along to the highest count since November 4. Our tally consisted primarily of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures, peppered with the occasional look at rarer birds, including a juvenile Bald Eagle and several American Kestrels. <br/><br/><br/>

<p>Weather that felt more like spring than late November meant a beautiful day on the hill for today's Hawkwatchers, with clear skies and temperatures in the upper 60s to low 70s. Although the counting was slow at times, lots of variety was observed, with 10 total species sighted. Highlights included a close look at a subadult Golden Eagle, a first for this team this season, and yet another juvenile Ferruginous Hawk. Peregrine Falcons were also flying close by today, giving Hawkwatchers great looks at both adult and juvenile plumages.<br/>

<p>Where are all the birds?  That question was frequently asked today up on the Hill as the Hawkwatchers endured a too warm for late November day.  Although the count wasn't too high, the Thursday II crew still managed to spot 10 species including three White-tailed Kites and four adult Cooper's Hawks.  A number of birds demonstrated proper migration technique, catching thermals right above the platform before zooming south towards The City.  A Merlin also passed close overhead and, based on its uneven tail feathers, we could tell it was an adult that had molted.  In the second to last hour, Hawkwatchers were treated to a dark-morph juvenile Harlan's Red-tailed Hawk. <br/>

<p>A hot first hour on the Hill was mitigated by a cooling breeze from a low fog layer that stuck with us for most of the daywe had temperatures from the mid-60s to the low 70s and gentle winds that shifted southwest in the afternoon. Although our number of raptors counted was relatively low, we compensated with an interesting distribution of species: more Northern Harriers than either Sharp-shinned or Cooper's Hawks, as well as sightings of a Bald Eagle, a Ferruginous Hawk, and several very cooperative Merlins. <br/><br/>BALD EAGLE (SOUND)BYTE:  Did you know  that the Bald Eagle has a far from impressive call?

<p>Pizza, pizza, pizza! chanted the interns as they entered the office at the end of a wonderful day. They weren't just hungry; they spotted the first Rough-legged Hawk of the season and guaranteed the Tuesday II team pizza for the next cycle. In addition to the first Rough-legged Hawk, we also completed the fuzzy leg trifecta with an adult Golden Eagle and a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk. Other highlights of the day included a light blue-gray female Peregrine Falcon, two White-tailed Kites and a 360-degree virtual reality experience. You may question what we mean by this, well we are baffled by the same question. Upon arrival at Hawk Hill, Hawkwatchers were greeted by a student film crew equipped with an amplifier, camera equipment, and dancers on the center platform. We started our count at 10:00am to give them an opportunity to shoot some footage. Cheers to an unusual but exciting 13 species day!<br/>

<p>Today was another blustery day, and the strong winds seemed to discourage hawks from flying. The wind gusted up to about 10 mph and predominantly blew from the north and northwest, bringing chilly temperatures to Hawk Hill. Although the thermometer read in the mid-50's for most of the day, warming up to the low-60's in the afternoon, the wind-chill made us feel much colder. Visibility was amazing, however, as we had great views all the way to San Jose. We mostly counted Red-tailed Hawks today, split evenly between about 35 juveniles and 35 adults. While the long-awaited Rough-legged Hawk was still nowhere to be seen and we were also not visited by any Ferruginous Hawks, we were treated to two White-tailed Kites and 13 American Kestrel sightings. We also got some great views of Peregrine Falcons over the city and swooping up onto the Golden Gate Bridge.<br/>

<p>The morning rain and the predicted gale force winds didn't deter the Sunday I team from making it up to the Hill for their second to last Hawkwatch of the season.  However, these predictions proved to be false when winds never reached above 25 mph (at the edge of the North Quadrant).  Bird activity varied throughout the day with the largest amount of birds seen from 10-11am.  There was heavy Peregrine Falcon activity between 2-3pm, with 7 total seen throughout the day.  A juvenile Bald Eagle provided some excitement in the early afternoon. First believed to be a distant Turkey Vulture, it eventually rose up in the West Quadrant and revealed its large size in comparison to the stooping Red-tailed Hawk.  <br/>

<p>Hawkwatchers' identification skills were challenged by poor visibility today, as a purplehued haze obscured a significant portion of the Bay and seemed to intensify the glare of the sun on the water. The weather was pleasant despite the odd air quality, with temperatures in the mid-60s and low 70s and very light, variable winds, practically nonexistent until a mild West wind kicked up in the afternoon. As small kettles of Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and Ravens formed and dissipated throughout the day, our vigilant Hawkwatchers kept an eye out for unusual raptors. Much to our luck, an Osprey and a White-tailed Kite were spotted at a close distance, in addition to several nearby Northern Harriers. The three typical falcon species also graced the Hill with their presence today, including a gorgeous male American Kestrel who enthralled us as he circled over our heads.  The Rough-legged Hawks spotted at Pt. Reyes may not have decided to move Southward today, but we'll be ready for them when they do! <br/>

<p>High numbers of Red-tailed Hawks kept our counters on their toes today, testing our ability to pass birds between the quadrants. Eleven of the 252 Red-tail sightings today were of dark morph birds, making it a little more exciting to see the migrating Buteos. Speaking of exciting Buteos, one solitary Swainson's Hawk was seen today, a rare sighting for this time of year in the Headlands. Most of these birds have already moved on from the Central Valley to South America. Hopefully this loner makes it in time to meet up with its family for Thanksgiving in Argentina!<br/>

<p>FOUR FALCON THURSDAY: For a relatively slow day on the Hill, we had some special moments, including a Prairie Falcon that flew directly over top of our hawkwatchers, bringing the count to four falcons for the day! We had minimal winds primarily out of the north and west and temperatures in the high 50s and low 60s. The precipitous drop in accipiters was obvious today: in total, we spotted only 23 Sharp-shinned Hawks and 6 Cooper's Hawks. Given that the bulk of our count consisted of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures, we were happy for spurts of variety, including several Merlins, a handful of Red-shouldered Hawks, a blackish dark morph Red-tailed Hawk, and an adult female Northern Harrier. <br/>

<p>Beautiful weather finally blessed the Wednesday I Hawkwatch team, allowing them their first full day on the hill after being cursed by rain and fog earlier this season. Although numbers were low, we did have nine Northern Harrier sightings and a beautiful view of a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk silhouetted against the Golden Gate Bridge. An extremely low-flying plane kicked up the adrenaline level and made our team question whether or not to duck out of the way. Thanks to some high-powered optics, we were able to get the registration number off of the plane and call it into the parks dispatch. <br/>

<p>Clear skies and sunshine made for a pleasant, if chilly, day on the hill, with temperatures in the high 50s and low 60s and variable wind. We were treated to many great looks at adult Peregrine Falcons, including a very pale individual that may have been from the Tundrius subspecies. One Peregrine even obliged us with a flyby near enough for some close-up photos. Northern Harrier juveniles were the other highlight of the daywe saw six juveniles and one adult male.<br/><br/>PONDERING PEREGRINES: Peregrine Falcons, or Falco peregrinus, include many subspecies (up to 19 have been accepted by bird guides). Of these, we see three. The Tundrius subspecies was first described by C.M. White in 1968 and is paler than our other subspecies.  <br/><br/>

Thunderstorms and lighting boomed throughout Rodeo Valley, causing Hawkwatch to be cancelled.

<p>It was a beautiful, clear, sunny day, but there was not quite enough wind to bring in a lot of birds. A few highlights include a Tundra Peregrine Falcon and a potential Harlan's Hawk.

<p>It was a great day on the Hill- clear and sunny, with a bit of cool. The team was energetic and had hopes to see the first Rough-legged Hawk, but alas, no luck. We instead got great looks at Merlins, Ferruginous Hawks, and a juvenile Bald Eagle. Yippee! We saw flurries of birds forming kettles mixed with quieter times throughout the day. We also saw several dark morph Red-tailed Hawks, a Harlan's Hawk, and a Short-eared Owl for good measure. <br/>

<p>Tails, Tails and more Tails! Today was a chilly November day with a mix of sun and clouds. There were light winds in the morning and a stronger breeze as the day ended. It was a big day for Red-tailed Hawks and a strong Northern Harrier showing with a mix of juveniles and adults. We missed our intrepid Dayleader and our interns, but we soldiered on under the expert guidance of George and additional help from some drop-in's. <br/>

<p>It was a beautiful sunny day with unlimited visibility. The morning started out "knock-you-down windy," with winds from the north and a constant flow of birds to go with it. When the winds died down in the afternoon, the birds got scarcer. Temperatures were in the 50s in the morning and the 60s in the afternoon. It was big day for Red-tailed Hawks with 270 sighted, including 11 dark morph juveniles and two dark morph adults. Also exciting was having a Double-Eagle day! We had two Bald Eagles, one juvenile and one adult, and one adult Golden Eagle. Even though we were missing our Dayleader, Allen, we had a great time on the hill. The only negative was spotting a drone in the air over Hill 88. Headlands visitors should remember, it is illegal to fly drones in all National Parks, so please find a more suitable location to fly your devices. <br/>

<p>After the rains that cancelled yesterday's Hawkwatch, today's counters were treated to beautiful, clear skies. Temperatures ranged in the sixties and the slight wind consistently blew from the west-south-west throughout the day. While the number of raptors remained fairly low, today was a great day for spotting a wide variety of species. During the morning meeting, this team reminisced about this day one year ago when 15 species were spotted. While we only reached 11, we did spot the very first Bald Eagle of the season. This bird appeared in the Northeast, and was identified as a juvenile by its brown breast and belly and white wing-pits.  Another exciting moment of the day was when an adult Peregrine Falcon chased a juvenile right over Hawk Hill, giving amazing views of these beautiful birds and great photo opportunities. At the end of the day, Dayleader Mary's wish to see a White-tailed Kite finally came true, as this team spotted one in the West quadrant for Tuesday II's first time this season. This was a great last day before the interns leave for the Raptor Research Foundation Conference in Sacramento. The blog will pick back up on Monday, when we return to the Headlands!<br/>

<p>Fog, fog, fog, sun, fog, fog, fog. Throughout the day, the sun battled the fog, but ultimately it surrendered. We started out the day at the Annex and moved to Hawk Hill at 10:30. However, the Annex gave us a better show than the hill. While Hawkwatchers watched an American Kestrel in Kirby Cove, a Peregrine Falcon appeared behind it. Though it did not bother the Kestrel, the Peregrine Falcon decided to complete a series of dives on the resident adult Red-tailed Hawk pair. Once we made it up to the hill, the day was very slow with only 27 sightings and three species.<br/>

<p>This morning started out warm on the Hill, with some lingering fog that blew in and out throughout the day. Luckily, a westerly wind blew in during the early afternoon, cooling us all down from temperatures in the mid-70s to high 60s and bringing the highest number of birds we've seen in a few days. These included excellent looks at close-flying Accipiters, especially adults. Other highlights included many Red-tailed Hawks and several Northern Harriers showing off their pumpkin bellies, just in time for Halloween!<br/><br/>TRICK OR TAIL?

<p>Warmer weather and clear skies brought more birds to our Hawkwatchers today, with high numbers of Accipiters and Red-tailed Hawks keeping the counters busy. Our Accipiter proportions were similar to our peak counts were, with approximately three times as many Sharp-shinned Hawks as Cooper's Hawks. Many of these Sharp-shinned Hawks were heading directly south across the Golden Gate, leading to lots of undocumented age class birds. With the bright light reflecting off the water in the east and south, it was difficult to make out the plumage to distinguish juveniles from adults. A dozen Merlin sightings added excitement to the day, as did multiple adult female Northern Harrier sightings. A juvenile Golden Eagle was sighted in the afternoon, answering the team's morning wish for an eagle, any eagle! <br/>

<p>The beautiful weather today was a welcome reprieve from the fog, rain and wind of the last few days. Temperatures ranged from the low sixties to mid-seventies, with clear skies throughout the day. The wind began in the northeast and east in the morning and later shifted to more westerly directions. This weather brought greater numbers of both individual birds and species than had been seen recently. Today was a great day for falcon-viewing, as we saw lots of American Kestrels, Merlins, and Peregrine Falcons, many flying close by over the hill. We saw both adult and juvenile dark morph Red-tailed Hawks, along with a likely Harlan's Hawk. Unfortunately, this bird with unusual plumage did not give us a good enough look to be certain if it was this rarer type. Intern Elan introduced a number of school groups to Hawk Hill, and the hawks treated the students to some awesome close views.<br/>

<p>The day started out at the Annex because of the fog capping Hawk Hill. While waiting, we got a great look at an adult Red-tailed Hawk perched in a tree. As the fog began to burn off, we ventured up the hill to find sunny skies and no wind. Throughout the day, the wind never picked up and temperatures remained in the mid-70s to low-80s. Wind direction predominated from the east, but changed occasionally to the south. These unfavorable weather conditions limited the number of hawks we observed. While we mostly saw Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks, we were excited to see a Ferruginous Hawk after a weekend lacking these majestic raptors. Other notable sightings were several Peregrine Falcons and a perched Merlin.<br/>

<p>It was a hazy day up on the Hill with temperatures fluctuating from the high 50s to low 80s and variable winds that shifted north in the afternoon. We had moderate numbers with eight species for most of the day until the last two hours, when two White-tailed Kites, a Peregrine Falcon and a male American Kestrel appeared in the north quadrant. Red-tailed Hawks were the heavy hitters of the day, with 142 sightings, including a beautiful, very light juvenile male who gave a lovely show during the banding demo. The light markings on his back and some black breast feathers led Hawkwatchers to discuss whether he might just be an intergrade between a typical Red-tailed Hawk and a Harlan's Hawk, a Red-tailed Hawk subspecies.<br/><br/>HARLAN'S HISTORY: Formerly considered a separate species, the Harlan's Hawk was reclassified in 1973 as a subspecies of the Red-tailed Hawk. It is characterized by a lack of rufous coloration and more black feathers on the upperparts, as well as barring on the outer primaries in juveniles. There is a stable zone of intergrade between Harlan's Hawks and typical western Red-tailed Hawks. <br/><br/>

<p>Fog kept the team off the hill in the morning, but we made the most of our time by looking for the vagrant White Wagtail at Rodeo Lagoon. Unfortunately we weren't able to spot this Eurasian species, but we did see some visiting fall ducks and had a nice walk before heading up to check out the visibility up top. Fog still shrouded the peak of Hawk Hill so we spent some time waiting at the Annex by the roundabout, where we were able to spot some raptors down in Kirby Cove and along Slacker Ridge. As soon as the hill cleared at a quarter to one we were on our way, and managed to spot seven species of raptors during the official count time. Highlights included a few Northern Harriers, zooming Merlins, and a lovely adult Red-shouldered Hawk. <br/>

<p>One tail, two tail,<br/>Red tail, brown tail,<br/>Dark tail, light tail,<br/>Adult tail, juv. tail.<br/><br/>This poem, inspired by the illustrious Dr. Seuss, describes one of our most abundant raptor species of the day. While raptor activity overall was relatively low, we spotted 122 Red-tailed Hawks, second in numbers only to Turkey Vultures, as usual. Two dark-morph adult Red-tails were spotted in the afternoon. We were shocked and dismayed when the daily Ferrug failed to appear, and also missed the Golden Eagles that had been appearing often in the last week. We did get to see an Osprey and a White-tailed Kite, species that were a little more common earlier in the season but hadn't been seen as often lately. We were entertained by the appearance of a Raven with two large feathers sticking out at odd angles; this bird could clearly use some practice in proper preening technique. <br/><br/>AND NOW, THE WEATHER: Today was sunny with only a few clouds, but hazy in the distance over the city. The haze and strong light made visibility poor when viewing far-off birds. Wind began in the northeast and east and shifted later in the day towards the west.<br/><br/>

<p>We had a sunny, clear day flush with Merlins on the Hill, with temperatures in the low 70s and generally northerly breezes that shifted from east to west over the course of the afternoon. Our first sighting of the day was a Merlin that ushered in a pleasant flow of birds, bringing us to about 100 raptors per hour from 11 am to 1 pm. A fairly high number of Red-shouldered Hawks (11 in total) showed off their crescents for us, while our life bloodRed-tailed Hawkskept us busy throughout. Not to be forgotten, our daily Ferruginous Hawk arrived between 2 and 3 for the requisite admiration of the Hawkwatch.<br/>

<p>The day began with a case of déjà vu. The day began with a case of déjà vu A familiar looking raptor appeared over Slacker Ridge and the Hawkwatchers took notice. What initially appeared to be a strange Red-tailed Hawk was later recognized as a dark morph Swainson's Hawk. Perhaps, this was the same individual spotted on yesterday's watch. In the afternoon, a distant Golden Eagle was spotted in the North Saddle. While there was much debate over the age when looking through scopes, a photograph taken by one of our Hawkwatchers cleared up the matter. This individual showed both juvenile and adult feathers, indicating a second-year bird beginning its long transition into adult plumage. Along with these interesting sightings, we also observed the daily Ferruginous Hawk, the Golden Gate Bridge Peregrine Falcon and four American Kestrels. <br/><br/>Today's Weather Report: Temperatures slowly increased from the high-60s to the mid-70s around noon. A shift from eastern to western winds cooled us down in the afternoon.<br/><br/>Fun Fact: The opposite of déjà vu is jamais vu, or the sensation of having never seen a familiar word before.<br/><br/>

<p>Merlin Madness! A total of 23 Merlins were spotted today as they zipped by the Hill, moving south in a hurry! The day started slowly, with winds from the south and east, bringing some interesting birds into south quadrant (but not much elsewhere). Temperatures ranged in the comfortable high 60s and low 70s throughout the day. Around noon, the wind shifted to the southwest and, surprisingly, numbers began to pick up and a slew of uncommon and unique birds flew by the Hill. Our daily Ferruginous Hawk appeared around this time, continuing the surprising streak of sightings throughout the season. Hawkwatchers applied the weekly intern presentation on aging Golden Eagles to not one, but two, Golden Eagles that were seen today! As the 2:00 hour began, everything became a blur as the sky filled with falcons and Red-tailed Hawks. As two Peregrine Falcons locked talons, a leucistic adult Red-tailed Hawk soared above. This bird had completely white upperwing coverts, while the flight feathers and tail showed normal plumage. A bird that first appeared to be a dark-morph Red-tailed Hawk was then discovered to be a dark-morph Swainson's Hawk, one of only a few this season. The day ended with the glorious release of our second telemetry bird this year, a male juvenile Red-tailed Hawk dubbed "Gypsy". We look forward to following Gypsy's travels for the next week or so and wish him luck! You too can follow his flights at www.ggrotelemetry.blogspot.com.<br/><br/><br/>

<p>It was quite eventful up on the Hill today, with lower numbers of Accipiters but still a good amount of diversity seen.  Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, and swirling winds!  White-tailed Kites, Peregrine Falcons, and Golden Eagles!  Not to deviate from the current trend, a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk flew by in the afternoon.  A Peregrine Falcon also gave the Hawkwatchers a good show, repeatedly stooping on a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk.   Adding to the drama, a small plane practically skimmed the platform in the morning and in the afternoon two drones appeared high in the skies, including one that fell and crashed into the hillside. <br/>

<p>A generally overcast sky in the morning gave us false hope that things would clear out for a nice afternoon Hawkwatch, especially because we had winds out of the W and NW and moderate temperatures in the low 60s. We had just enough time to count several representatives of our common species and two Northern Harriers. Unfortunately, a dense fog rolled in at 12:30, prompting us to leave the Turkey Vulture tally for another day. Hawkwatchers enjoyed watching the banding demo, given by docent Randy Breaux, before heading off the Hill.<br/><br/>GULL GUFFAW: Why don't you see seagulls flying over the Bay?

<p>Variable conditions throughout the day kept us guessing while up on the Hill, including a generally westerly wind and temperatures in the low to high 60s. We saw weather appropriate for seemingly every month of the migration, from late summer to early winter. One minute, raptors were flying, while the next minute, we were covered in fog (and even a few stray raindrops)! Highlights of the day included two Ferruginous Hawks and a very pale-headed Red-tailed Hawk that made some of our Hawkwatchers do a double-take. <br/><br/>RAPTOR RHYMES: The weather today was confusing, but not as frigid as the snow storm described in the hawk-inspired poem below.

<p>Light winds and low fog offered a nice reprieve from the past few scorchers.  It was an overall pleasant day with increasing sightings of adult Accipiters and another great look at a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk that did a slow pass past the platform before heading to The City.  There was an interesting sighting of a dark morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawk that was very light colored on the dorsal side.  A juvenile Northern Harrier provided a nice send-off to the Hawkwatchers, popping up just below Fish Rock during the final minutes of the count.  <br/>

<p>Similar to yesterday's weather, Hawk Hill suffered from intense heat in the early part of the day. Yet this did not inhibit Hawkwatchers from seeing some wonderful raptors. The first half-hour only had five sightings, but an adult Peregrine Falcon and a juvenile Northern Harrier gave us hope for improvement. That hope was met (and exceeded) when Natasha spotted a large, dark, non-Red-tailed Hawk.wait! It's a dark morph Ferruginous Hawk! Many agreed that this could be the best bird of the season, and all were satisfied when it gave us a lingering close-up before heading towards the Bridge. <br/><br/>DARK MORPH DATUM: Of the species seen at Hawk Hill, all of the Buteos except for Red-shouldered Hawks show multiple color morphs, but only three percent are dark morphs. <br/><br/>

<p>With little wind and scorching temperatures, not many raptors were spotted today. Yet, our songbird count reached 176.3 individuals per hour as large flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons and Violet-green Swallows swarmed around the hill.  Though the raptor hourly counts were low, a large variety of species were seen. This made the heat a little more bearable. During the second hour of the day, nine species were counted including a late-season Osprey and the two Golden Gate Bridge dwelling Peregrine Falcons. Along with these two species, ten juvenile Northern Harriers flew through the north quadrant throughout the day. Here's hoping for more wind and more raptors tomorrow. <br/>

<p>Despite a thick layer of fog blanketing the ocean and San Francisco, we had clear skies and great views of many amazing raptors and planes for the last day of Fleet Week. Our dependable flow of Red-tailed Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, and Cooper's Hawks came with a consistent Northwest wind that kicked up mid-morning. Later in the afternoon, warmer temperatures generated thermals for large kettles of Turkey Vultures. We may have seen many juvenile Ferruginous Hawks in the past few weeks, but few sightings have been as spectacular as today's individual, who circumnavigated the entire Hawk Hill summit!  An adult female Northern Harrier also visited the Hill, illustrating complex hunting patterns. <br/>

<p>Fleet Week performances made Hawk Hill this Saturday II a popular destination and offered some extra spectacle for Hawkwatchers on a somewhat slow day. The morning started with dense fog, but it rolled out for great visibility in the afternoon. We started our count off right with close-up views of a White-tailed Kite and a Broad-winged Hawk, both displaying their classic field marks. Our trusty Red-tailed Hawks and Accipiters ruled the day thereafter, and Hawkwatchers got in some field entomology practice, spotting approximately 40 butterflies. We also enjoyed a visit from young UC Santa Cruz ornithologists and several Audubon groups. Once the Blue Angels got going, we had several seemingly surprised birds fleeing the scene and (happily) increasing our total species numbers, including a Merlin and an Osprey!<br/>

<p>Although the day was hot and got off to a slow start, the birds, whales, ships, and planes put on a good show for the Hawkwatchers. Fleet Week festivities kept the south quadrant interesting as the parade of ships passed under the bridge in the morning, and a pair of gray whales could be seen feeding in the middle of the lineup. Two adult Peregrine Falcons and one juvenile sped by the south platform, reminding everyone that there were birds to be counted too. Lots of Accipiters kept the Hawkwatchers on their toes, as did several raptor ID studies from the banders at Hawk Blind. Large kettles of Red-shouldered Hawks tested everyone's scope skills from the far north, and our daily dose of Ferruginous Hawk appeared right in front of our eyes as we were working the distant birds. The afternoon concluded with the Blue Angels jets flying close enough overhead to wave to the pilots, and the team left slightly sunburned but in good spirits. <br/>

<p>Today the skies were filled with interesting flying non-raptor objects, as Fleet Week kicked off with Blue Angels' practice flights. Raptor activity overall was low, but two pairs of adult Peregrine Falcons,  two Ferruginous Hawks, and eight juvenile Northern Harriers kept us glued to the sky. The lack of activity may have been related to the still air and warm temperatures felt in the morning, but things picked up later in the day. The peak for adult Accipiters may be approaching, as both Sharp-shinned Hawk and Cooper's Hawk adults were spotted in proportions much higher than before. A nocturnal raptor species seen today was a Great Horned Owl, oddly enough, perched on a telephone pole in the South Quadrant at 3 PM. We anticipate more planes and raptors in the coming weekend!<br/>

<p>A hazy day on the hill gave way to increasing winds in the afternoon.  The hawks were flying and giving great views with a nice midday peak of Sharp-shinned Hawks and Red-shouldered Hawks, including a few adults thrown in the mix.  The highest species diversity and count occurred during the 12 o'clock hour, including a distant White-tailed Kite, a few Merlins, and the trusty Golden Gate Bridge adult Peregrine.  We had a lovely visit from the kindergarteners of Marin Horizon School, whose teacher, Kathleen Hazelton-Leech, has been bringing her Red-tailed Hawks for a visit on the Hill for 30 years.

<p>What's better than a Golden Eagle?  Two Golden Eagles! After two cycles of extreme weather, almost 100 degree heat and cold winds, Tuesday II finally had excellent hawk watching weather which brought in some terrific raptors. The close head-on view of a Broad-winged Hawk kicked off the day's excitement. Around noon, the cry of Ferruuugg! could be heard across the platform. Everyone turned to the north to see a Ferruginous Hawk hovering nearby. However, the real excitement occurred when two juvenile Golden Eagles were spotted over Angel Island. What an excellent way to celebrate Pat's four score birthday and Molly and Nick's last days on Hawkwatch. Happy Birthday (UNHHH)!<br/>

<p>Today was a warm and busy day on Hawk Hill, with the Accipiter migration continuing to flow steadily. After two cycles of extremely hot weather, the Monday II Team was grateful for pleasant winds and a moderate temperature. We were joined by another Audubon birdwatching group eager to observe the migration and spot some unique hawks. They were rewarded with the sight of a few juvenile Broad-winged Hawks, one of which was a dark morph. Later in the day, we also were haunted by a Gray Ghost, an adult male Northern Harrier, followed by an amazing head-on view of a Ferruginous Hawk. The Hawaiian Chieftain, a gorgeous tall ship, heralded the end of the day with cannon fire as she entered the bay.<br/>

<p>A hazy day on the hill did not prevent the Hawkwatchers from tallying up 845 sightings of hawks. Accipiters were flying left and right and Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures accumulated in massive kettles throughout the day. Throw in some Merlins and Broad-winged Hawks and we had ourselves a raptor party. As the wind increased into the afternoon, our unidentified Accipiter count increased as well. Along with great sightings of hawks, many visitors came to the hill throughout the day. We had an excellent group of inquisitive guests at our Hawk Talk and Banding Demonstration. Overall, it was a wonderful day to spend on the hill.<br/>

<p>What a crazy day! The morning started off slowly, with thin fog moving in and out of the Headlands and obscuring most of the birds. The day ended with winds strong enough to blow over the strongest of Hawkwatchers! Nevertheless, we had a strong finish with over 500 raptors counted in what was really a 3 hour (rather than a true 6 hour) day. The falcon game was intense today, with multiple overhead views of Merlins and Peregrine Falcons. We even got to practice birding by the tail with several male American Kestrels. We continued to build on a larger-than-average year for Ferruginous Hawks, with three close-up sightings. Glad we got off Hawk Hill before we started losing volunteers to the wind. Thanks Saturday I and see you in two weeks!<br/><br/>TAIL TALES: For many raptors, the outer tail feathers, technically called the 6th retrices, are a different size or color than the rest of the tail feathers. One excellent example from today on the Hill was the male American Kestrel, whose 6th retrices are white with black spots, in contrast to the rest of the tail (mostly rufous, with a large black subterminal band and a white terminal band). <br/><br/>

<p>Hopes were high for a good day on the Hill, and the Hill did not disappoint! Early in the morning as the count began, Hawkwatchers were treated to the sight of a Short-eared Owl that flew close enough to see clearly without binoculars right by the West and North quadrants. This excitement was followed by a steady flow of Accipiters, Red-shouldered Hawks, and Broad-winged Hawks, the latter of which provided some great views as they formed a kettle right overhead in the fifth quadrant. Fair weather brought past and present Hawkwatchers and their friends from all teams to the Hill today, crowding the North and East quadrants with scopes and hundreds of cumulative years of Hawkwatching experience. The South and West quadrants didn't feel left out, as they were entertained by humpback whales feeding and spouting off of Point Bonita.<br/>

<p>This morning on the Hill was cloudy with intermittent fog, but cleared for an idyllic day, pleasant and sunny. The pace of activity seemed evenly spread today, with raptors graciously timing their migration to suit our identification needs! We had three glorious looks at Ferruginous Hawks, all showing off their three points of light (tail and wing windows). Northern Harriers charmed us with four chances to check out their white rump patches and pumpkin orange bellies. It was also a decent Merlin day, with four swift looks that were made better by occurring almost directly overhead. We were joined by a new team member, Caryl Carr, and got the news that our wonderful Christine Lamphear will be leaving us for new beginnings in Reno, NV. We wish her the best of luck, and welcome the very experienced Caryl to the team! <br/><br/>BROAD-WING BROADCAST: We would be remiss if we didn't mention our excellent, close-up views of Broad-winged Hawks today on the Hill. Broad-wings are eastern migrants that, for many years, were not believed to occur in California. We've catalogued their travels over Hawk Hill for an average of about 200 sightings per season. <br/><br/>

<p>After a wet and windy morning, the intrepid Wednesday 1 Hawkwatchers were finally treated to a good couple of hours on the hill. After retreating under the south platform during the morning rains, we were pulled out by the sight of a Broad-winged Hawk flying up the valley. The birds just kept coming after this sighting, with Ferruginous Hawks, Accipiters, and more Broad-wings putting on a show. Although the day had a slow start, the afternoon made the wait worthwhile. <br/>

<p>Although today's count didn't have the huge numbers of raptors that we've been seeing lately, it made up for it with diversity and exciting sightings. A total of 12 species were seen, including one White-tailed Kite and a Golden Eagle. We witnessed a dramatic confrontation between two adult Peregrine Falcons and one juvenile right in front of the north platform-the adults took turns dive bombing the juvenile and calling loudly to chase it from their territory.  At least two Humpback Whales entertained the east and south quadrants in the afternoon by feeding and diving right in the mouth of the Bay, giving everyone a great look at tails and spouts. <br/>

<p>The day started off at the Annex as we waited for fog to clear off the top of Hawk Hill. Monday I seems to have a weather curse, as we were fogged out last cycle and 3 of our 4 days so far have been foggy! We did get a nice look at a Kestrel perched in a tree as well as some Accipiter action. Once on the Hill the fog hung close by and didn't clear until the very last hour of the day. Despite this, we were still able to see 381 raptors representing 10 different species. The special bird of the day was a dark-morph juvenile Broad-winged Hawk that flew by several times. We also had some nice looks at Merlins and juvenile Northern Harriers (pumpkin spice season is starting, after all!). At the end of the day we were treated to a pair of Peregrine Falcons chasing Ravens and showing off some spectacular stoops. While the weather was cold and windy and the HPH was lower than it has been of late, we still had a nice day and enjoyed watching the raptors we could see through the fog.<br/>

<p>The day began with a nice stroll along the lagoon as the Hawkwatchers waited for the fog to lift.  Lagoon sightings included: three river otters, Greater Yellowlegs, Eared Grebes, and a daring deer that walked through the middle of the lagoon.  Once we got onto the Hill around 11, activity picked up with flurries of accipiters, kettles of Broad-winged Hawks, and crowds of excited birders on the platform hoping to catch a glimpse.  The highlight of the day was the five Merlin sightings in one half hour.  We retreated at the day as the wind and fog continued to persist; hopefully it clears for the Super/Blood/Harvest Moon eclipse tonight! <br/>

<p>The weather in the morning on Hawk Hill looked bleak, with dense fog rolling over us from every direction. Mercifully, the weather improved significantly and cleared completely by noon, making for a great day of Hawkwatch. Since this group has been fogged out twice, Hawkwatchers were thrown into peak and faired amazingly well, especially with those tough accipiter calls. Along with our excellent view of accipiters, we were lucky to see two Peregrine Falcons in the final hour; one diving on an unfortunate Sharp-shinned Hawk. And we were joined on the Hill by a posse of aspiring Hawkwatchers, all under age twelve. Their enthusiasm (and accurate birding) gave us hope for the future of GGRO. Look out for Eddie's forthcoming book of hawk photography and ID techniques, hitting stores in 2030. <br/><br/>FUN FERRUGINOUS FACT: In the past ten years, GGRO has counted an average of 23 Ferruginous Hawks per year. This year to date, we've already seen 16. Our data shows the peak Ferruginous Hawk day typically falls on September 27th, so we are hoping to have a far better than average year for this species.<br/><br/>

<p>Sharpies ruled the day today on Hawk Hill with 226 total sightings. Volunteers were entertained as they shot from the West quadrant across the walkway, giving everyone a great view on their way into the city. Highlights of the day included a photo-shoot of a juvenile Ferruginous hawk, close passes by a Merlin, and an adrenaline-filled pursuit by a juvenile Northern Harrier by the banders at Hawk Blind. (The banders didn't get this one, but Hawkwatch got a great show!) Stray Broad-winged Hawks continued their southern migration, mixing into large kettles with Red-tailed Hawks and Red-shouldered Hawks for some Buteo identification practice. All in all a fun and busy blustery day! <br/>

<p>The craziness of yesterday did not carry over into today, possibly because of the increased heat and lack of wind.  The total number of raptors dropped from >1000 to ~700.  Despite the decreased number of hawks we still had great looks at a few Ferruginous Hawks and a fair number of Broad-winged Hawks.

<p>JAILBREAK, WE NEED BACK UP! The hawks were flying fast and furious today up on the Hill.  The weather, for a change, was neither scorching nor freezing.  As the Hawkwatchers crested the platform in the morning, kettles of Broad-winged Hawks began rising from multiple directions, inciting a mad scramble to set up scopes, get on binos, and assemble in quadrants.  Both Accipiters were flying en masse, providing good identification practice for all. The quadrant system communication relays were tested as hawks flew every which way, including beautiful overhead views of a Merlin, adult and juvenile Broad-winged Hawks, a juvenile Peregrine Falcon, and many Red-shouldered Hawks. We also had a lovely, long look at a Prairie Falcon. But nothing could beat the luxurious flight of a Ferruginous Hawk (flashing its famed three points of light in the near-ideal viewing conditions) who, having enthralled the entire Hawkwatch, conjured a partner. Both of them flew onwards towards the Golden Gate, the Hawkwatch looking on in awe. Many thanks to the helpful guests who joined the team to keep our tally up to speed; we're happy to report that the data sheet looks the worse for wear!<br/><br/>NUTTY NUMBERS: Today was the third highest one-day count in GGRO's history, after September 25, 1999 (1,283 sightings; 206 HPH) and September 21, 1984 (2,833 sightings; 404 HPH)!<br/>

<p>Whale, whale, whale the last three days were scorching, but look who rolled back into town: our good friend Karl the Fog. Though we didn't see many birds today, we saw a glorious whale.  While yesterday's heat drove in great diversity of species, today's cold and windy weather seemed to discourage raptors from flying. Some individuals braved the harsh conditions and were blown in circuits around the hill giving all quadrants a look. The few birds we had allowed Hawkwatchers to practice passing off raptors from one quadrant to the next and hone their identification skills.<br/><br/>Whale, we are going to blow your mind with this cool whale fact:<br/>In 2011, Varvara, a Gray Whale, swam 14,000 miles from Russian to Mexico and broke the record for the longest mammalian migration.<br/> <br/>To read more about Varvara, check out this link: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/150414-gray-whale-pacific-migration-endangered-ocean-animal-science/<br/>

<p>Today Hawkwatch broke this season's species record by sighting 13 different species on the Hill! Notable birds included two close-flying Ferruginous Hawks, a Golden Eagle, and almost 20 Broad-winged Hawks. Continuing the trend of the last week, Accipiter numbers remained high, and the greatest challenge of the day for newer Hawkwatchers was differentiating between Cooper's Hawks and Sharp-shinned Hawks. Non-raptor sightings included 487 Vaux's Swifts and 8 fighter jets performing aerial stunts over the Headlands. The great number and variety of raptors seen today made braving the high temperatures worth it, and Hawkwatchers were rewarded with a cool breeze at the end of the day. <br/>

<p>As the temperature reached above 95 degrees, one Hawkwatcher said, It's getting hot up here, so we should leave Hawk Hill. Though the stifling weather caused us to vacate the platform early, we were able to see many species and individuals throughout the day, including an adult Broad-winged Hawk and multiple juveniles, a few juvenile Northern Harriers, and nine Red-shouldered Hawks. Also flying in the sky were flurries of dragonflies and butterflies. Sadly, they didn't lure a Merlin into our viewshed. Throughout most of the day, the raptors chose to fly extremely high and in kettles, making hawk watching even more challenging. <br/>

<h2><a name='20150919'/>Saturday, September 19, 2015</h2>
<p>For our second day of peak migration, we saw an accordingly high number of raptors and species for a spectacular and exciting (but HOT) day! Numbers of Sharp-shinned Hawks overcame those of Cooper's Hawks, though our two Accipiters are still neck-and-neck for the season. We saw a high number of Red-shouldered Hawksincluding two adultslikely because of the still, warm conditions. Hawk watchers were ecstatic to see eight Broad-winged Hawks, two Ferruginous Hawks, and the first Swainson's Hawk of the season all in one day! With numbers like these, we're looking forward to more peak days.<br/><br/>SWAINSON'S SECRET: Though we only see an average of six Swainson's Hawks per year at the GGRO, they are far more plentiful in flooded agricultural fields around Davis, CA, just an hour and a half's drive inland (depending on traffic!). But don't wait long to check em outthey're headed to Argentina for the winter!  <br/><br/>

<p>Today got off to a quick start with a fast flow of Accipiters in the morning. Hawkwatchers were kept on their toes identifying large numbers of Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks, which were often flying in kettles containing both species. Perhaps the most exciting sightings of the day were several photo-worthy views of juvenile Broad-winged Hawks, giving the team our closest look of these little Buteos so far this season. Migration is definitely ramping up at Hawk Hill! <br/>

<p>This morning started out overcast and chilly on the Hill, but things cleared up through the day to give us an exciting hawk watch! Nevertheless, our slow start failed to discourage us thanks to the cheering presence of dayleader Josh Haiman's new Siberian Husky puppy, Helena (so much CUTE!). Our Accipiter numbers have been building: today we saw 48 Sharp-shinned Hawks and 49 Cooper's Hawks. Other highlights of the day included the first eagle of the season, a juvenile Golden Eagle, which graced us with its presence in the final minutes of the count (it appeared on the scene over the FM towers at approximately 3:25 pm)! Below the Golden Eagle, Josh spotted the only Broad-winged of the day, making for an exciting end to the afternoon.<br/><br/>WING WITTICISM: Did you know that both airplane wings and boat sails are modeled after bird wings? The curve of the wing creates differential pressure above and below the wing (or sail), creating lift or forward movement. We enjoyed watching this principle come to life in the form of an intense regatta playing out below Hawk Hill.  <br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>

<p>After an early morning flurry of Accipiter activity, dark clouds and rain slowed the raptor flight to a trickle and Hawkwatch left the hill at 1:00. Luckily, spirits were lifted shortly before this early end by a pair of whales displaying just west of the Golden Gate. Everyone got a look at the tail slapping in their scopes and binoculars, and whale-savvy Hawkwatchers determined them to be a mother and calf humpback whale pair. Despite the rain, the Wednesday 1 team left the hill with high spirits and plenty of practice differentiating Sharp-shinned Hawks from Cooper's Hawks.<br/>

<p>Merlins and Ospreys and Sharp-shinned Hawks, oh my! After three days of fog, Hawkwatchers finally made it up to the hill for a full day of counting. We were rewarded with high numbers of Accipiters, ten Ospreys, and ten Merlins, as well as a couple of Broad-winged Hawks. Hopefully the predicted rain will move through quickly and blow more hawks our way later this week. <br/>

Hawkwatchers only saw two Turkey Vultures from the Annex while waiting in the cold, windy mist before returning to 1064. Better luck tomorrow.<br/><br/>

<p>Good half day on the Hill! We had a great time spotting many non-raptor species and three river otters in the Rodeo Valley Lagoon while waiting for the fog to clear. Ever hopeful, we hiked up to the Hill at noon and had a wonderful hour and a half of Hawkwatch and Outreach programs before being enveloped in the fog again. Even for such a short observation time, numbers of Sharp-shinned Hawks seem to finally be increasing! A juvenile Northern Harrier also gave us and the Hawk Talk participants an amazing view of both the signature white rump patch and pumpkin orange breast before flapping away into the fog. Thanks Sunday II for a fun mini day of Hawkwatch!<br/>

<p>FOG DAY<br/><br/>The day started off with a patchy and shifting fog layer, so Hawkwatchers remained optimistic and made the trek up to Hawk Hill. However, howling winds and thickening fog forced us to retreat to the valley floor, where we were treated to the sight of an American Kestrel and a Great Horned Owl. Despite the inability to see any raptors on Hawk Hill, a mini Hawk Talk was enjoyed by a few brave, shivering participants at the base of the Hill. Come mid-afternoon, the winds at the top were still strong enough to blow away small children  and the visibility was down to ten feet, so the Saturday II team decided to call it a day and try again in a fortnight. We look forward to a clear and busy peak day in the near future!<br/><br/>

<p>The day started off with Hawk Hill appearing as an island above a foggy expanse, San Francisco and the Golden Gate nowhere to be seen. However, Hawkwatchers soon shed their many layers as the fog burned off. Raptor activity and weather up on the hill today were moderate; the wind kept the heat off of our diligent Hawkwatchers but didn't blow us off the hill, and the raptors kept us entertained but didn't overwhelm us. The highlights of the day included an early morning Merlin zooming through the fog, pausing only to catch an insect midair, as well as a few Northern Harriers giving us some prime examples of their unique silhouette and flight pattern. Overall, it was a pleasant day for the Friday II Hawkwatch, and we look forward to returning in two weeks for the migration peak!<br/>

<p>The morning started off HOT with low fog blanketing the South quadrant and sneaking through the Golden Gate.  Raptor activity was low and the Hawkwatchers occupied their time counting songbirds and flies of the dragon and butter variety.  Thankfully, around midday a breeze picked up, cooling off the hill and the raptors started to appear.  Notable sightings included a female American Kestrel, a few Osprey, and a female Northern Harrier.  As the wind picked up in the afternoon the team was treated to a stilling color banded Red-tailed Hawk hanging out between the West and North quadrants.  This individual returned at the end of the day to see the Thursday II team off the hill.  <br/>

<p>It was a hot Wednesday on the Hill, but early temperatures in the high 80s and low 90s were relieved in the afternoon by a welcome breeze out of the northwest. Although our count started slow, things picked up with beautiful views of an Osprey making its way from the rifle range to the Golden Gate, as well as of a stunningly pumpkin orange-breasted juvenile Northern Harrier. Thanks to the stellar spotting skills of Christine Steck, the team also got an excellent look at a Prairie Falcon! Other highlights included the appearance of 18 Black Swifts over the course of the day. Anna Fryjoff-Hung, one of our research interns, kept everyone hydrated with Top of the Hour Toasts, during which all were encouraged to take a swig of water.  <br/>

<p>Today was one of the hottest days on Hawk Hill in recent memory, with temperatures reaching 100 degrees. The heat seemed to discourage the raptors from flying in the early afternoon, as our sightings steadily declined before our team called it a day an hour early at 2:30. Early morning highlights included Osprey, some Cooper's Hawks, and a couple of Sharp-shinned Hawks. Visitors to Hawk Hill this week should be prepared for high temperatures with lots of ice water, hats, and a source of shade, and should consider an early morning trip instead of an afternoon one. <br/>

<p>Today was one of the hottest days experienced up on the hill thus far, but our valiant Hawkwatchers stuck through to the very end! Even the Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks vacated the hill as temperatures climbed into the mid-nineties with no wind for relief. The "5th Quadrant" (the sky directly above the site) was especially busy today with many birds taking advantage of the thermals available. This gave Hawkwatchers good practice in distinguishing individuals in a kettle of different raptor species. Although warm weather is expected for the rest of the week, both Hawkwatchers and hawks are hoping for some cool winds in the coming days! <br/><br/><br/>

<p>It was a hot, sunny, visitor-filled day on the hill with temps reaching 90 degrees and minimal wind.  Hawkwatchers were cautious of overheating; lots of sunscreen and water were applied.  A squawk from the banders over the radio alerted those on the hill to the presence of a Broad-winged Hawk, the first of the season, flying high in the sky.   The call was seconded as High-Visibility Herb, recognized by his bright bike attire, summited the platform.  However, after the Broad-winged Hawk, raptor activity began to dwindle.  Turkey Vulture numbers continued to climb steadily throughout the day and there was a flurry of accipiter activity in the final hour.  <br/>

<p>We couldn't have asked for a more beautiful, clear day on the Hill for the first day of Hawk Talks and Banding Demonstrations. It was also the best day so far for total number of raptors counted, with a slightly higher total than yesterday's count. Highlights of the day included a beautiful overhead view of a Northern Harrier, an uptick in Cooper's Hawks, and a very cooperative Merlin who gave our newcomers a lingering look! In non-raptor news, three rare black swifts made a rare appearance above the south platform; we added three species each of butterflies and dragonflies to our bug sheet; and we were excited to witness a praying mantis pass us by.<br/><br/>HOLY HARRIER! Harriers are one of the few species we see on the Hill for which we distinguish adult males, adult females, and juveniles. Juveniles have a famously orange breast, typically described as "pumpkin" in tone. Females are comparatively streaky in the breast, which is unusual for an adult raptor (usually, juveniles are "streaky," while adults are "barred"). Males wear the nickname "The Grey Ghost" for their pale undersides, light grey wings, ghostly grey head, and supernatural yellow eyes.<br/><br/><br/>

<p>The best way to summarize today's hawkwatch is slow, but steady. Over the course of the day, we saw nine different species and 356 individuals with 59.3 hawks per hour.  Even when the hawks were not present, it was lovely to be on the hill with mellow winds and clear skies all day. With sightings of juvenile and adult Peregrine Falcons, apprentices and interns had a great opportunity to compare the different plumages. Other highlights included a Northern Harrier in the last five seconds of Hawkwatch and an Osprey with very conspicuous molt. <br/>

<p>It was a gorgeous early September day on the Hill with gusty winds and lots of sunshine. The more unusual species were scattered throughout the day to keep us on our toes, starting with three morning Osprey who got the day off to a bright start. We caught great views of a Prairie Falcon, who obliged us by flying almost directly overhead before peeling away towards San Francisco. Two raptor identification study birds sent to us by Hawk Blind gave us a chance to sharpen our Accipiter identification skills, and a late-showing White-tailed Kite, called excitedly in by the west quadrant, left us feeling satisfied with our tenth species of the day.<br/><br/>ARCHAIC ENGLISH FACT: We misspelled "bird" today and learned something new--according to the University of Michigan's Middle English dictionary, "brid" (also "brede," "berd," "burd," and "bord") is Middle English for the young of a bird.

However, Tuesday 1 observed a variety of raptor species spread throughout the day, including an Osprey, an American Kestrel, and a Peregrine Falcon. Hawk Hill frequent fliers (Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures) were also present. Although today was relatively slow in terms of raptor activity, the hawk watchers had a reason to celebrate: Allen Fish, GGRO's beloved director, celebrated his 30th anniversary with the program today! Treats were provided and the volunteers got to hear Allen's favorite memories since he started working here in 1985. Congratulations, Allen!<br/>

<p>Today started off slow but ended up setting a record for the total number of species, with several species seen for the first time of the season. The first few hours, Hawkwatchers felt stuck in the doldrums, and the interns in the west quadrant counted only three Turkey Vultures in a whole hour. The day became more exciting  when Ouch!, a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk recently outfitted with a GSM transmitter, appeared in the north quadrant and gave us a good look at her transmitter. San Franciscans, look out for Ouch! travelling over the city. A little while later, Hawkwatchers spotted an interesting Turkey Vulture that had white marks on its shoulders rather than a solid black back. Things started to heat up in the one o'clock hour, as new species besides our usual customers began to appear. The stars of the show were a beautiful juvenile Ferruginous Hawk and a Prairie Falcon that flew past us from Hill 88. These sightings were the first of the season for these two species! Other species of note were a White-tailed Kite, Red-shouldered Hawk, Northern Harrier, and multiple Sharp-shinned Hawks and American Kestrels. After spotting the leucistic Red-tailed Hawk last cycle, it seems like Monday I is continuing our streak of spotting awesome raptors!<br/>

<p>Sunday 2 up on Hawk Hill was pleasantly sunny and windy, with a moderate amount of raptor activity. The wonderful weather and views brought many visitors to the hill who were quite curious and enthused to learn what we were looking at and yelling about. Today, we spotted many of our signature Turkey Vultures and juvenile Red-tailed Hawks, with a noticeable abundance of adult Red-tailed Hawks. To spice things up in the late afternoon, a handful of Cooper's Hawks, Ospreys, and a singular adult Red-shouldered Hawk blew by the hill. Overall, it was a good first day for the Sunday 2 team, and we look forward to seeing many more species on the hill as the migration season continues!<br/><br/>HAWK FACT: Californian Red-shouldered Hawks were previously called Red-bellied Hawks due to their vibrant orange chest and belly. These hawks are most often found in oak woodlands and near rivers, but are also common in urban areas where eucalyptus groves are present.<br/><br/>

<p>Today was an uneventful day on Hawkwatch. The fog rolled into Rodeo Valley yesterday at 3:30pm and never left. After the morning meeting, we were hopeful and headed up to the annex. However, we could not even see Kirby Cove. We returned to the valley for some small bird sightings before calling it a day. <br/><br/>FOG FACT: Carl Sandburg wrote a six line poem about the San Francisco fog.<br/><br/>"The fog comes<br/>on little cat feet.<br/><br/>It sits looking<br/>over harbor and city<br/>on silent haunches<br/>and then moves on."<br/><br/>Today, you can follow the SF fog on Twitter at @KarlTheFog.<br/><br/>Here is a sampling of today's tweets:<br/>"I'm dewing a lot already."<br/>"I run this town."<br/><br/><br/>

<p>Today was a hot and clear day on the hill. We started off our counting at noon with a healthy dose of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures, followed quickly by a male American Kestrel that was an identification study bird from the banders at Hawk Blind. This early action was followed by some good Accipiter practice for the team as we had a good fly-by by a juvenile Cooper's Hawk. The weather stayed hot until the breeze picked up and began to blow the fog in as we left the hill, and we were treated to the sight of a wedding taking place over Kirby Cove! The Friday 2 team had a positive first day on the hill and we look forward to more birds next time around. <br/>

<p>It was a dark and stormy night. Actually, it was the exact opposite: the brightest, sunniest day we've had on Hawk Hill so far. The clear day allowed us to spot a bounty of raptors, and by the end of the day we totaled 9 different species.  Hawkwatchers were excited to spot the first Merlin of the year far off over the Golden Gate Bridge, identified in a spotting scope. It was a good day for watching Northern Harriers, as four individuals offered great views of their white rump patches and brilliant orange juvenile plumages. The day also stood out in the number of American Kestrels seen, often in male-female pairs. The quadrant system worked especially effectively today when a number of individual raptors flew around the entire hill and each quadrant passed the bird on to the next. Thursday II looks forward to continuing this great teamwork and counting many more raptors this season!<br/><br/>LITERARY FUN FACT: In T.H. White's novel The Once and Future King, the wizard Merlin turns a young King Arthur into a Merlin to learn lessons from the hawks in the castle's mews. A second fun fact: T.H. White himself experimented with falconry and wrote a book about his experience titled The Goshawk.<br/><br/>

<p>It was a beautiful sunny day up on Hawk Hill today.  Although only four species of raptors were seen, there were many highlights.  A few dark morph Red-tailed Hawks were seen; allowing our hawkwatchers to get some good long looks in as the circled the hill.  An adult Peregrine Falcon put on a show in front of the Golden Gate Bridge, stooping multiple times on a juvenile Red-Tailed Hawk.  And a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk required a double take as it had a few adult central tail feathers.  <br/>

<p>The streak of good weather continued with another clear and sunny day. The good weather brought some great sightings of seven different species of raptors. We completed three different ID studies and the last bird, a Red-tailed Hawk, gave us an excellent view. After its release, it decided to perch on the rock right in front of the north quadrant (we were even able to read part of its color band). The new apprentices were blessed with excellent sightings of two Osprey, a juvenile and an adult Peregrine Falcon, and a Red-shouldered Hawk. Towards the end of the day, the wind and fog began to roll in along with a pack of six Turkey Vultures, one of which was packing a rotten lunch. After holding on tight to this hunk of meat for several minutes, its prize was snatched away by a sneaky Raven. This dramatic exchange wrapped up a lovely day on the hill. <br/>

<p>Monday II was blessed with the best weather since the season began: warm (but not hot) temperatures, good visibility aside from some haze, and, most importantly, no fog! The great conditions brought in a bounty of raptor species. Along with the usual Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and Cooper's Hawks, we spotted Osprey, White-tailed Kites, Northern Harriers, American Kestrels, and a Red-shouldered Hawk for a grand total of eight species. This team also enthusiastically counted butterflies and dragonflies, and was able to identify 8 different species, including a few not included on our insect count form. On a team half-filled with first-year apprentice Hawkwatchers, returning members enjoyed training these newer volunteers. Monday II looks forward to an awesome season of Hawkwatching! <br/>

<p>Today was an eventful day on the Hill. We had a nice, sunny start with a Peregrine Falcon and two juvenile Turkey Vultures, as well as the first Northern Harrier and Red-shouldered Hawk of the season! We spotted two Ospreys and an assortment of Redtails and Turkey Vultures in the early afternoon before the fog rolled in. Dayleader Bob Power's singing kept the group entertained throughout the afternoon. A big thanks to Eli Gross for joining us today before he leaves to count raptors 7 days a week in Kiptopeke, Virginia. Have fun, Eli! <br/>

<p>Upon arriving at the office, all of the Marin Headlands was trapped in fog. The day did not look promising for Hawk Watch. After a fun meeting, we decided to wait and see if the fog would dissipate. While stalling, we took a stroll up the Miwok Trail into Gerbode Valley in search of some birds. We spotted two Red-tailed Hawks, a Great Blue Heron, and a few passerines. At 1:00pm, we looked up to Hawk Hill for signs of clearing fog, but it remained immersed.  Sadly, no count was completed today. The Friday I team looks forward to our first true Hawk Watch day!<br/>

<p>The first Thursday of the migration season was chilly up on the Hill, with dense fog early in the day that cleared for better visibility in the later afternoon. Hawk counting picked up over the course of the day to accompany increasing winds, with 34 of our 81 hawks (42 percent!) appearing between 1 and 2 pm. We mostly saw Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures, but were graced by the presence of 3 Peregrine Falcons and 1 quick-flying Cooper's Hawk for a rate of 23 hawks per hour.<br/><br/>Hill Highlights: Volunteers on the north side of the Hill enjoyed watching a coyote stalk prey through their spotting scopes. And when a Peregrine Falcon briefly faced off with a Red-tailed Hawk, everyone on the Hill gasped in unison. <br/><br/>

<p>Today was a great first day of the season on the hill for Wednesday I. After a raptor slideshow refresher the crew headed up to Hawk Hill just in time for the raptors to start flying (Tim B. reported that nothing had been coming by until we arrived).  Apprentices and interns were teamed up with veteran Hawkwatchers and everyone got to work in their quadrants.  It was cloudy, but warm, and the birds were flying.  Some highlights included a fast flying falcon that was kind enough to circle around for a positive ID as a male American Kestrel and a last minute accipiter that turned out to be a juvenile Cooper's Hawk.  Currently 1 for 1 on the Hawk ID study (juvenile Red-Tailed Hawk) for this team.  <br/>

<p>Today was a foggy day up on the hill, but we were able to see a wide variety of raptor species. The most notable sightings happened in the second hour of the count, when we saw an Osprey fly from the north quadrant to the west, followed by another an hour later (Neither of them were packing a lunch yet). In a hawk ID study, our team successfully identified a juvenile Cooper's Hawk that was released by the banders in Hawk Blind at the end of our count.

<h2><a name='20150817'/>Monday, August 17, 2015</h2>
<p>Today was a foggy but eventful first day of the Hawkwatch season! After arriving to a hill full of fog, pockets slowly started to open up after 11:30am. Many juvenile Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures flew through the skies, allowing the new apprentices and interns to practice identifying some of our sites most common raptors. The monotony of continuous Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks was broken by sightings of two beautiful American Kestrels, male and female, and five accipiters which challenged the ID skills of all on the hill. Then off in the distant fog, a group of juvenile Red-tailed Hawks soared over the southern hillside, but one bird was not like the others. The pale, white color of the bird was initially explained by the poor visibility in the southern quadrant. However, as the bird traveled into the clearer east quadrant, volunteers realized it was a partially leucistic Red-tailed Hawk! This individual had a completely white upper side, while the underside displayed typical juvenile plumage. Hawkwatchers were flush with excitement upon viewing this rare individual in flight. Though much of the day was foggy and windy, this incredible bird was the perfect kick-off to Hawkwatch. Perhaps this bird was an auspicious sign of a unique 2015 season.<br/><br/>INTERDISCIPLINARY FUN FACT: In ancient Roman times, priests interpreted the flight of birds to determine the favor of the gods, a practice known as Augury. The eagle was a symbol of Zeus, king of the gods. <br/><br/>

<p>Not only did we get out on the hill today, we got out ON TIME.  Whether or not this was to delay the onset of our end-of-the-season "review" is subject to question.  We hauled our luxurious food bounty up to the summit only to watch the rainclouds advancing from the south, eventually hitting us in the face.  However, we managed to squeeze in a few sightings before the onslaught of rain and snarfed as many snacks and cups of coffee as one can when trying to maintain the quadrant system.  Don't worry, best beloved, because we managed to have an entire feast upon returning to headquarters--enough food to cushion the blow of having to take a test (I'm sorry, a "review").   <br/><br/>So thank you Friday II for a lovely, albeit rainy, foggy season!  Raptor on!<br/><br/><br/>

Instead, we ate delicious food and discussed world events, poetry, and small living things. All together, a fun day although relatively devoid of raptors (we did briefly see one or two foggy Red-tailed Hawks).<br/><br/>Thanks for an amazing season, Thursday II!

<p>Today was cool because you could literally look into the future.  Today the future came from the South and the future was rain.  We were (impressively) only sprinkled upon once after watching the giant plumes of rain skirt around us in all directions all day.  Hard to say whether the weather (intentional!) was keeping the birds down or if there were, in fact, no birds in the first place.  Our bridge Peregrine falcons conducted their 10:00 patrol of the area which has become kind of a standard.  Large kettles of Turkey vultures sprinkeled with a few Red-tailed hawks were abundant in the morning, but by late day we were hard pressed to see any raptors of any kind.  Luckily we were content to feast on an assortment of foods and casually spy on the ravens.  We left the hill under a full rainbow, which is a first for me and felt especially majestic and symbolic.  O, to be somewhere under the rainbow!  Why hasn't anyone written a song about that?  It feels like a missed opportunity.<br/>

<p>While today brought much needed rain, that meant that the last day of the season for the great Sunday I team...was a bust. We did manage to make it up to the annex and watch the only three birds in the air (two red-tailed hawks and a brave turkey vulture). As we watched these birds...we also managed to produce a nice spread of food on the bench, while the southeast winds became even more gusty. Eventually the winds brought the rain from Sutro towers...and here we are.<br/><br/>Good luck Monday II <br/>

<p>Thank goodness we weren't rained out. The fog swirled around us and raptors were nowhere in sight. The definite highlight of the day was a very upclose and personal look at a beautiful Merlin. Then, the fog decided to envelope the entire hill. So, we called it a day. Lucky for us, we have plenty of food to keep busy, and plenty of good company. Good luck Sunday I. Stay dry and full.<br/>

<p>Today the Friday I team finished off the season with a calm day of slow raptor flow but high species count (since were a quality over quantity type of group). Some of the highlights of the day were some showy aerial displays by the adult Peregrine pair, an Osprey that flew in front of the sun and the early-rising moon, and some interestingly-colored Red-tailed Hawks. We counted far more visitors (556) than raptors today, but still managed to spot hawks from between the massive throng of post-Thanksgiving visitors, and had many great opportunities to explain who we are and what we do. I felt a little better about the activity rate when I would tell kids what our numbers were for the day and watch their eyes widen in awe (youve really seen over a hundred birds today?!).<br/><br/>Thanks Friday I for your attention to detail, love of learning, and mutual support. Its been a great season. <br/><br/>

<p>Birds, birds, everywhere and not a bird to eat?   Perhaps not a raptor to eat.  However, there be not one, but TWO turkeys for our GGRO Thanksgiving feast.  The live bird tally for today far exceeded our turkey countby 111 times, in fact.  The day was warm and windless, with a thick haze falling over the bay and ocean.  We climbed the hill with three pies and fresh Dungeness crab in hand, and came down with our load considerably lightened.  Birds were mostly in distant kettles and were mostly Red-tailed Hawks.  A few accipiters and a Merlin zipped below us around the curve of the hill, but otherwise the majority of our birds were out over the Slacker hills, Mt. Tam, and Hill 88.  We were lucky enough to have a chocolatey-brown dark morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawk as one of our study birds, which immediately went and perched below the north platform.  In summary, today was a good day with good food and good people and birds were the whipped cream on top of the pie.  Thanksgiving metaphors, away!  Happy Turkey Day, raptor enthusiasts!<br/>

<p>Today was a great sendoff for what has arguably been the seasons luckiest hawk watch team. The day started off with a pair of adult Peregrines dive-bombing on a group of Pine Siskins. The majority of birds for the day still consisted of Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks, but we also saw a bunch of Northern Harriers and American Kestrels. The biggest highlight of the day was a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk that swooped in from Kirby Cove and made a tour of the hills. We had a wonderful time sharing snacks, enjoying the pizza that was our reward for spotting the Rough-legged Hawk last time we were out, and explaining migration patterns to all of the pre-Thanksgiving visitors on the hill.<br/><br/>Thanks for an exciting season full of beautiful days, high numbers, unusual birds, and lots of enthusiastic teaching and learning, Wednesday I!<br/><br/>

<p>We had a blustery day up on the hill. Although the birds were few the fancy cheeses and baked goods brought by the hawkwatchers were many. Our highlights of the day were a male kestrel and a harrier, which might give you an idea of how slow it has been (but really it was SLOW). Hopefully Wednesday will pick up an exciting bird tomorrow...maybe of the feathered tarsi variety.  <br/>

<p>While it was a pretty slow day on the hill, we had lots of joy and food. The weather was nice and calm, but started to warm up around the afternoon. We saw lots and lots of red-tails, but we also saw the "bridge" peregrine falcons claiming their territory and run off every bird that decided to cross the Golden Gate Bridge. <br/>Good times, good birds, and good food made for a great season with the Mon I group. <br/><br/>We will miss you Mon I<br/>

<p>Today was a day that started just like any other.  We met for a morning meeting while another intern and I rambled about something or another ( just kidding it was a riveting talk on Rough-legged hawks).  However, early in the morning we realized that today was indeed very special. Today we saw not one, not two, but three Broad-winged hawks! We also had a few oddly late Osprey sightings as well, including a beautiful bird that flew right over us. So although we did not see the Rough-legged hawk that we all yearned for, today was indeed something to behold. <br/>

<p>After waking to torrential, sideways rain this morning we came to work fully prepared to be rained out.  We lazed around, ate cookies, and had a leisurely powerpoint presentation.  Lo an behold when we opened the shades we were blinded by unexpected sunlight!  So we hurredly scrambled up to the hill to find the birds already circling.  A juvenile Northern Harrier and a handful of Red-tailed Hawks cruised around while we set up camp and began the count.  Early morning Peregrine Falcon fly-bys made things exciting.  There was much Red-tailed Hawk attacking to be had.  While things slowed considerably by the end of the day, we had our sixth species (Merlin!) zip by below the north platform thus enabling us to go out with a bang.  What a lovely day to come from such a tumultuous beginning!<br/>

<p>If omens were real, today would have been a fabulous buteo day.  Before we had even reached the summit of Hawk Hill, we found we had been beaten to it by a massive juvenile Ferruginous Hawk.  It made some lazy circles over the bay and hung around for a good 10 minutes while we all took our respective ganders.  We then settled into preparing for a jawdropping day spilling over with raptors.  This quieted gradually into a day of looking hopefully into an empty sky.  We were able to pick up a Red-shouldered Hawk, an adult Sharp-shinned Hawk and a few close Red-tails to curb the hunger, but these petered off and by 1:00 there were barely Turkey Vultures even on the ridges.  We are at least proud to say that we positively ID'd all of the raptors that we saw (i.e., no unidentified raptors).  The sky was overcast and everything had a wintery cast which made it beautiful albeit cold.  We looked over our shoulders as we left, wondering if we were going to miss that one Rough-legged Hawk that waited until 3:35 to fly over the hill, but saw nothing.  Now it's time to put our hands under hot water, make some cocoa, and prepare for the next wave of rain.  <br/>

<p>Though it was a chilly day with low numbers of raptors, the Tuesday II Crew huddled together on the hill for some great hawk watching. We were visited by an adorable Ruby-crowned Kinglet, and got a close up view of an adult Red-tailed hawk as he stooped down a few feet by our faces. We also saw a juvenile Bald Eagle flying across the bay, but it decided to come back to the Headlands for a longer stay. Even the calm bay waters awarded us with a beautiful view of a Humpbacked whale.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a great day, with crisp fall air. Good luck tomorrow Wednesday II.

<p>There are days when human perseverance and camaraderie triumph over challenging circumstances.  Today was such a day.  It's was also Ken's birthday.  There were cupcakes.  There were also thousands upon thousands of American Robins (mixed with Varied Thrushes), all headed mysteriously northward.  Has anyone else noticed this?  Is it a sign of impending apocalypse?  <br/><br/>The wind out of the east and northeast was chilly and failed to bring us the birds for which we yearned.  So we bundled and un-bundled as the wind waxed and waned, and scanned the ridge lines feverishly.  <br/><br/>"Gull or raptor?  Wait...it's a gull.  Definitely gull."<br/>"Hold on, what's that falcon coming off Tam?"<br/>"It's a gull."<br/><br/>Yeah, it was one of those days. <br/><br/>High Red-tailed hawks were the bulk of our sightings, supplemented by the occasional accipiter or Merlin.  <br/><br/>Perhaps the most exciting bird was a Short-eared Owl with its deep, loping wingbeats headed towards Golden Gate Park, and later another over North Slacker.  It would seem that Hawk Hill isn't just for the diurnal raptors anymore.  <br/><br/>So everyone get ready for what might be the actual onset of fall and chilly weather.  Shove some gloves into your pack!  Bring your Big-Gulp-sized thermos!  If you have a body-suit windbreaker, this is the time to put it to use!  <br/>

<p>It was a gorgeous, sunny day up on the hill. We persisted despite not having our fearless leader, Mr. Power. Everyone pulled together to count the ever impressive number of redtails. Some highlights of the day included a great look at an adult Peregrine flying over us and a pretty personal look at a Ferruginous Hawk. We also got a great look at a late coming Swainson's Hawk. Overall it was a beautiful day with great diversity. Good luck Sunday I, don't forget your sunscreen and your sandals (with thick socks, just incase.)<br/>

<p>I cant say I was expecting much for the day after the rains, but we ended up with a good number of birds for this point in the season. There wasnt a huge variety of birds out today, but we are absolutely in the second Red-tailed Hawk peak. Some of the highlights of the day: A juvenile Northern Harrier and a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk chasing each other back and forth across the sky, some eye-catchingly bright adult Red-Shouldered Hawks that soared over Kirby Cove, an adult Red-tailed Hawk that decided to still right off the platform of Hawk Hill for nearly an hour, and the resident pair of adult Peregrines calling to each other as they sped by overhead. Overall, a very solid day. Hopefully the numbers will stay up and some more species will join the party. The weather is slowly edging its way towards the chilly side, so bring layers.<br/>

<p>After drizzling in the headlands all night, the rain showed no motivation to leave and sat low in the valley all day.  But what better opportunity for a Thursday I bonding session than a rainy morning?  We took a field trip to the Marine Mammal Center for some non-raptor education and then went on Newtwatch 2014.  While we only technically had two newt sightings, our walk also included some wet Red-tailed hawks, Red-shouldered hawks, a juvenile Northern Harrier and a female American kestrel.  Additionally, there were some mysterious reptilian eggs (?), a den with honeycomb outside, and a 5-legged Jerusalem cricket.  Ah, the wonders of nature!  Now for some soup!  <br/>

<p>Despite worries that late-day rains would make today a slow Hawkwatch, it ended up being an incredible day. Early on in the day we saw two adult Peregrines interacting with a raven, and we had a steady stream of male American Kestrels all day. However, the biggest jolt of excitement came when the Rough-legged Hawk finally arrived. It was a spectacularly dark bird, resembling more of a Turkey-Vulture with a Buteo head than a normal Rough-legged, but it flew around the entire hill and gave us all a look (albeit a slightly far and awkwardly-angled one). As if that were not enough, we also got to see a beautiful juvenile Ferruginous Hawk fly high overhead and show off its bright white underside. But wait, theres more! As the sunlight ebbed at the end of the day, we saw a very light bird with long, heavy wingbeats flying over the hills. A closer look revealed a flattened face and orange belly a Short-eared Owl! It flew around and fought with some ravens before drifting away towards Sausalito.<br/>

<p>Today began with a low inversion layer of fog straddling the hill sides. Quickly, however, the day heated up in temperature- but sadly not in hawk numbers. Despite the slow trickle of birds from the raptor faucet a few Peregrine falcons still "dropped" by. By about 2 we had been engulfed by the fog and decided to call it a day, catching a glimpse of that last minute merlin. <br/>

<p>The second Red-tailed Hawk migration peak that happens later in the season is in full swing now, and we are seeing a wide range of the color patterns that crop up within this species. We had a nice diversity of raptors, and even the Turkey Vultures were really moving on this sunny and clear day. The highlights for the day included good views of both Bald and Golden Eagles, a high-flying White-tailed Kite, and a light-colored Peregrine Falcon. We also got to see two Humpbacked Whales far below us at the gate of Bay. Were enjoying the relatively high numbers this late in the season. The winds were out of the North-East, and it looks like we could be gearing up for another nice week. Make sure to bring lots of sunscreen, however, since it is still unseasonably warm.<br/>

<p>Fog blog, 2014.  We could see around 56% of our surroundings at any given time today.  Given this, our count turned out nicely!  We had a short parade of Red-tailed hawks slide over the hill early in the day in the precious bit of blue sky above us, but from then on out they tended to be distant, foggy, blobby buteos.  We had a Sharp-shinned hawk that turned into a Merlin half-way over the Golden Gate Bridge.  Great silhouette work, everyone!  A late day Peregrine put us in the 3-falcon range and was a lovely parting view from the hill.  I think we were all hoping for another 15 species, 500 bird day.  Alas, the winds were not in our favor (specifically in that there was no wind).  But oh, to be serenaded by fog horns!<br/>

<p>Today was a little hazy and windless, but we had a reasonable number of raptors nonetheless. We saw a lot of adult accipiters and some good sightings of red-shouldered hawks. Todays highlight was a beautiful juvenile Bald Eagle that flew right over the hill. Alas, the Rough-leg is still elusive. The weather has been somewhat warm, so make sure to bring sunscreen and light layers.<br/>

<p>We had another gorgeous November day up on the hill! Although not quite as good as the 15 species day yesterday, we were still in a flurry of red-tailed hawks meandering back and forth.  We had a few dark morphs, but something else truly special drum roll please a dark morph Harlans red-tailed hawk!  The day was busy, but didn't quite feel like the 560 bird day it was thanks to the huge influx of red-tails. Aside from the red-tails stealing the show, we also had an osprey and a few merlins stop by (or zip by as was the case!)<br/>

<p>This morning, we were greeted on the hill by a flurry of raptors. It was a great foreshadowing for such an incredible day! We got a great number of Red-tailed Hawks and some great views of accipiters. Then, we also got to see some other, more unexpected, species. A Prairie Falcon gave us a great look as it flew up from Kurby Cove and a Broadwing graced us with his presence as he flew high in some thermals. Both are a little behind in the migration <br/><br/>Some other highlights were a far out Ferruginous and a Golden Eagle that flew right over us, giving us a great view of its white base on the tail and white wing panels. But the highest of highlights for the day, was an adult Bald Eagle, which gave us the record number of 15 species for this migration season! <br/><br/>Hopefully this flurry of activity continues into the week. The infamous Rough-legged Hawk has yet to be seen. Good luck Wed II. Dont forget your sunscreen and your parkas. <br/><br/>

<p>Holy hawkwatch, Batman!  He we were thinking it was a quiet, nippy November day when in fact the sky is ON FIRE WITH RAPTORS.  MORE RAPTORS THAN AT ONE COULD SHAKE A STICK!(?)  The day began slow and the pumpkin chips were consumed rapidly.  But then all around us, vast kettles of Red-tailed Hawks swept up from somewhere below the hill and had us craning our necks upwards!  Here a Merlin, there a Merlin and then suddenly a light falcon careening across south Slacker hill to perch, stoic, atop a rocky outcrop.  But was that our only Prairie falcon?  Nay.  Our second came lifting up from the rifle range and was silhouetted against the Point Bonita Lighthouse.  "Big falcon!  Really big falcon!  Someone please look at this giant falcon now, please!"  And sure enough, our second Prairie Falcon circled above us, peering down before a long flight to the city and beyond.  Similarly, our first Ferruginous Hawk rose nonchalantly amongst the sea of Red-tailed Hawks as if it were not some magnificent and gargantuan buteo.  Up and up and up until we had to look away due to its blinding whiteness.   <br/><br/>Was it a good day?  No.  It was a great day.  <br/>If you're allergic to falcons, stay inside.  <br/>

<p>HAWKWATCH WAS AWESOME TODAY!!! We not only saw our 303rd broad-winged hawk as we arrived on the hill today, but we later saw our 304th and 305th within ten minutes of seeing a Swainson's hawk and prairie falcon (around 115Pm PST). That is right folks, we saw all four species of falcons that can be seen yearly in the Marin Headlands. Perhaps we will get very luckly this year and see their big cousin, the arctic gyrfalcon! Anyways, it was a very birdy day which may have been due to the nice mild weather. Mostly calm NW and W winds along with an average temp of 66 degrees allowed hawkwatchers to gaze into the headlands without feeling pressed to add or subtract any layers. However, we had little to no fog cover, so some birds were very high in the sky and many hawkwatchers had to continuously apply sunscreen (others simply looked like bandits as they covered up their face with UV reflecting fabric). We are still on high alert for the seasons 1st rough-legged hawk, so be on the look out as the Mon II team is bound to see it tomorrow. Oh! Also, we saw a lot of Red-shouldered hawk movement today...perhaps it will continue throughout this week :)<br/><br/>GOOD LUCK WEEK II!<br/><br/>-Sun I <br/>

<p>The clouds were gorgeous today and the gusty Northwest winds brought us great falcon numbers! We got some great looks at some Merlins flying directly over the hill and the Redtail numbers are steadily increasing. Sadly, the Rough-legged is still up for grabs! Sunday I better make sure to keep a look out for those beautiful carpal patches. <br/>

<p>We had a decent day on the hill today as it was mostly clear until the fog rolled in around twelve oclock. Prior to our birding adventures on the hill, we were being told not to try to walk up the hill due to some filming that was going on. However, we were allowed to make it up just in time. Some of the highlights that we saw before the marine layer appeared were adult accipiters and a dark morph Red-tailed Hawk. <br/>Dont forget to bring a parka and some sunscreen, <br/>Thur I<br/><br/>

<p>It was sunny day with great winds on Hawk Hill and it brought us a rise in raptor numbers! We were over-whelmed with beautiful birds in the sky! We had a fantastic boost in Sharp-shinned hawks and it seems like the second Redtail peak is on its way! We got a first look at a blue-backed adult Merlin whizzing by the hill. The ravens were also being particularly frisky today, fighting with a Red-shouldered Hawk and some Redtails. <br/><br/>Sadly, there still hasnt been a Rough-legged Hawk sighting yet. So, good luck Thursday I and dont forget your sunscreen!<br/><br/>

<p>We had some beautiful goldilocks weather all day, not too hot and not too cold. Unfortunately the birds didnt find it just right. Despite a slow start to the day we did get quite a few merlins zipping along and a very special 302nd broad-wing hawk. We even got quite the show from a humpback whale under the bridge! Hopefully he or she doesnt decide to take too long of a venture into the bay.  Although we did see a humpback whale, were still waiting on the first rough-legged hawk of the seasonmaybe tomorrow!<br/>

<p>We went up with the expectation that the birds would be plentiful, numerous, gleeful with wild abandon after the passing of the rain from yesterday.  Its possible that they were gleeful in a nondescript way and their wild abandon conducted low amongst the bushes.  Wind out of the northwest sounded promising, but failed to produce the fruit of birds.  Some high altitude falcons and a single Golden Eagle kept us peering into the bright unknown, squinting and hopeful.  For so few total birds, we did see surprising diversity.  Still holding out for the first Rough-legged Hawk of the season!  <br/>

<p>Apparently, raptors dont like rain, since there were very few out today. The highlight of the day was the wonderful (penultimate) hawk talk delivered by Bridget and Nick Villa, accompanied by a well-behaved juvenile female Coopers Hawk. They covered a wide range of topics such as why we study raptors, why we study them in the Marin Headlands, and which one is the fastest. We even got to observe a Red-tailed Hawk as it stilled above the hillside and provided an excellent real life example. The last moment of excitement was a late Osprey before we left the hill to beat out the rain.<br/>

<p>What began as a beautiful day, quickly became engulfed in fog. While we didnt see many birds, we still had a great time, full of laughter. When the fog rolled in, we decided to head to the Annex where the volunteers decided to pick up the litter, doing our part to keep the Marin Headlands beautiful. Hopefully the rain will stay away for Hawkwatch tomorrow, but if not, we need it anyways. It will be one of the win, win kind of days!<br/>

<p>Is it possible for hope to burn away fog?  Since we cant prove that it doesnt, lets just say that we physically willed the fog to dissipate and were able to summit Hawk Hill.  Birds were popping over the hill early in the day, but dwindled by early afternoon.  We had a perfectly planar view of a Swainsons Hawk as it glided, un-flapping, from Hill 88 across the bay over to the Presidio.  The near-ish Golden Eagle was uplifting during the muggy heat of mid-day, and we had a few close encounters with adult accipiters.  We left the hill beneath a partial solar eclipse and chose to disregard any advice about not looking directly at the sun.  Update on intern cornea damage to come!  <br/>

<p>Today was a lovely hawk watch day, sunny and fairly fog free the whole day.  The biggest highlight of the day was 2 golden eagles.  Our merlin numbers are also starting to pick up the speed. For those birders out there, we even had a visit from a Townsends warbler!   We were visited midday by a nature bridge class who helped us bird for some time, and were quite talented! Hopefully the bird numbers pick up even more for tomorrows team! Good luck.<br/>

<p>Today as we got to the top of Hawk Hill, a beautiful dark-morph adult Red-tail greeted us as it flew overhead. Although the day was slow overall, it was a great day for Peregrine Falcons, and we even saw one fighting with a Merlin at the very end of the day. Were starting to see a lot more adult accipiters lately  a few flew right over Hawk Hill and gave us a great look at their orange-barred bellies. Hopefully tomorrow will bring lots of birds following yesterday's brief rain.<br/>

<p>Clear skies and wind out of the east early in the day brought us large kettles of Turkey vultures and ravens, with accipiters scattered in between.  Got a terrific look as a Broad-winged hawk scooted over the hill without any messing around and headed straight for the distant ridge.  A distant Ferruginous hawk and some late day Peregrine falcons rounded us up to a high species count for such a low count day.  As always, Saturday I went through an entire bag of ginger snaps and were persistently optomistic in the face of great heat.  Everyone bring your sunscreen and your mittens, watermelon and hot soup, and be ready, always, for anything.  <br/>

<p>Yet another fairly slow day. Although the weather was very pleasant from a human perspective, there was essentially no wind until the very end of the day, so perhaps not the best conditions for raptor migration. The Turkey Vultures were more or less the only raptors out in any numbers, but we did see a handfull American Kestrels and a couple of straggling Broadwing Hawks. Hopefully, the Headlands will get the expected (and much needed) rain soon, and if were lucky, the raptors will follow the storm front.<br/>

<p>The rains have come and gone...for now, and we had fantastic clearity for hawkwatching! This day exceed most of our expetations, but was not too overwhelming with fairly low numbers. Some of the neat birds seen on the hill were merlins(especially one that was attacking a sharp-shinned hawk), peregrine falcons, and a Swainson's hawk. <br/><br/>Good luck Fri I, <br/>Thur I out. <br/>

<p>Today was very, very slow. Even without as much rain as predicted, it seems as though the storm front might have disrupted the raptors migration since the sky was more or less empty today. We saw a lot of adult red tails, and the highlight of the day was three adult Sharp-shinned hawks. <br/>

<p>Wore shorts in preparation for a blisteringly hot day and ended up with popsicles for legs.  We ascended the hill and were greeted by a jumble of buteos and a fantastically proximal juvenile Golden eagle.  If not facing south, one could not see the ominous wall of fog rolling in from the Pacific and by 12:30 most of our landmarks were flickering in and out of sight as we became eerily shrouded in patchy fog.  We held out for a smattering of low Turkey vultures and a nearby blue-backed adult male Cooper's hawk.  But the 25 mph fog-filled wind drove us down in elevation and we called it a day back in a nice, warm, walled space.  Keep your eyes on the weather!  Free advice from me to you:  wear pants always.<br/>

<p>We were excited to get up on the hill this morning. The sun was shining and the birds were singing! Today was warm, but the birds didn't dissapoint. We had another very red-shouldery day, with many, many juvenile red-shoulders as well as several golden eagles. A 13 species day, not too shabby!<br/>

<p>Today was a strange day. It started out with what looked like inpenetrable fog, but as we hung out on the hill in an act of seemingly foolish optimism, a gap appeared. Then, a few Turkey Vultures and a Red-shouldered hawk drifted through the gap, and the count was on. The fog immediately parted and revealed a sky full of Red-shouldered hawks to more than make up for the relative derth of accipiters. We caught a beautiful sighting of a juvenile Ferruginous hawk soaring close to the ground. Then, later in the day as the fog rolled back in low in the valley, the Blue Angel airplane show revved up as a few straggling birds decided to show them what you can do without a really loud engine.<br/>

<p>Turns out that the silhouette slideshow came in handy today during our brief and foggy hawkwatch!  It was fog, fog, more fog this morning, so we decided to meander around the lagoon.  Grebes galore!  But we got wind of clearing on top of Hawk Hill, so up we went!  Alas, the fog was more persistent than us and we admitted to defeat after our 29th bird in an hour or so.  Where is this fog coming from?  And when will it leave?  And more importantly, where will people go to look at planes if this fog continues?  <br/>

<p>Today began with cake and fog and ended in cake and fog.  Everyone appreciated a long morning meeting, filled with literary discussion and flipping through Sibley's.  However, feeling obligated to go look at real, live birds, we went on a stroll to the lagoon and watched a Sora pick through the reeds and a few Eared grebes bob around a cluster of coots.  On the raptorial side, we were allowed spectacular views of an adult Peregrine falcon as it barraged a raven!  Also a juvenile Red-shouldered hawk, a pair of kestrels, a pair of Red-tailed hawks, and an adult Cooper's hawk.  It was still foggy up on the hill at 3PM, so don't feel bad about calling it at 1PM.  Hoping this blows out and we'll get a nice bird flow tomorrow!<br/>

<p>Today seemed like it would be another scorcher when we got up to the hill, despite the thick icing of fog on the cake that is marin headlands. It ended up being quite teeth chattering chilly at times. The day was somewhat slow, but we did get an excellent look at a dark morph broad-wing this morning to make it all worth while. We also had a kettle of about 20 turkey vultures who came over hawk hill to scrutinize our volunteer staff. Aside from the usual raptor suspects we had a Lewis and Acorn woodpecker. Better luck to tomorrow's hawkwatch!!<br/>

<p>At first, we doubted whether we would make it up to Hawk Hill today with all the fog. But then the weather cleared, and all the birds came out...all 240 of them. It seems like most of the raptors already cleared out with peak, but we still got a few good looks at some Sharp-shinned hawks with very full crops, juvenile harriers, and a bunch of colorful male kestrels.<br/>

<p>From the base of Hawk Hill, things looked dismal and the fog was thicker than buttermilk on a summer's day.  However, it was but an illusion for upon reaching the summit of Hawk Hill one could see to Mt. Diablo and beyond!  As we stood overlooking a sea of fog with only the tops of the Golden Gate Bridge towers peeping out, what emerged from the mist but a monstorous and gleaming white buteo!  Lo and behold, a Ferruginous Hawk!  Buteos here, buteos there, buteos, buteos everywhere.  While the bird flow was a trickle at best, we were able to squeeze in 11 species with only 233 sightings.  The wind by the end of the day was as welcome as a familiar cat instead of a racoon in your kitchen when you get home.  So let's hope the heat gives us a break and the birds keep a-movin'!  <br/>

Broad-winged hawks made an appearance, though we expect them to become a rarer sight as we march into October. Hot day, but supposed to cool off for tomorrow.  Continue constant hydration vigilance.

<p>Today was HOOOTTTT, which was perfect for Hawaiian shirt day up on Hawk Hill! We felt the heat on the hill and the raptors felt it in the sky. Activity was slow most of the day and the raptors were flying high. We did get a great look at an Osprey that flew around the hill. We hope it picks up for the Sunday group.

<p>Today was both literally and figuratively a "hot" day for hawkwatching: our raptors per hour almost exactly matched the degrees farenheit at the end of the day (99.3 and 97.6 respectively). We toughed out the heat and were rewarded with two Ferruginous Hawks, a bunch of accipiters, a pod of dolphins, and migrating black swifts. If you are planning to come up to Hawk Hill this weekend, I strongly advise bringing plently of sunscreen, and about twice as much water as you think you might possibly need.<br/>

The temperature started to rise as did the hawk counts. We enjoyed the special treat today of multiple close sub-adult  golden eagle sightings and an adult broad wing.

<p>Today started out glorious and windy. We were surrounded by raptors flying everywhere. As the sun rose higher in the sky, our hopes for the day began to rise with it. We got great views of a Swainson's hawk flying overhead and a distant Prairie Falcon flying ever so close to the sun. Every quadrant was shouting with joy and yelling out species. Then, as the sun continued to climb, the wind slowly died, creating a very still afternoon. We were still continuously graced with accipiters and Red-tailed hawks. The day ended up being a record day for sightings and tying for species numbers. After such a glorious day, we were walking down the hill, and saw species number 15, a beautiful Ferruginous hawk. It was a great way to end the day.<br/><br/>Good luck to the hawkwatchers tomorrow. Make sure to bring plenty of water and wear sunscreen. It's going to be a scorcher up there.<br/><br/>Wednesday 1 out.<br/><br/>**Note that actual hawks per hour was 141.9 and hours counted was 6.41.

<p>While today was super foggy, we saw so many sharp-shinned hawks! In nearly every break of fog within the first three hours were many accipiters. We also saw this season's hight number of broad-winged hawks. Towards the end of the day, the fog broke up and finnaly showed us some decent mixed kettles of red-tailed hawks, broad-winged hawks, accipiters, and the occaisonal turkey vulture. While we were given a brief moment of great happiness by a deceptive turkey vulture, which we thought might have been a head-on golden eagle, we were treated to hawk nirvana at the end of the day in which we saw 80 sharp-shinned hawks and our seconed Swainson's hawk of the season. <br/><br/>Peak is here!<br/>-Tue I<br/>

<p>Today was one of those days where you begin at the Annex and see a Ferruginous hawk, but then hike up the hill and see no Ferruginous hawks for the rest of the day.  That being said, raptors were numerous despite low visibility and biting wind.  We've started to see adult accipiters come through and flaunt their grown-up plumage like they own the place.  We're still on a Broad-winged hawk kick and seeing them everyday, regardless of weather and the multitude of people oggling them.    <br/>

<p>For being such a big count day, things stayed suprisingly smooth and unchaotic on the hill.  Fog gave and fog took away, but visibility was enough for us to track small groups of accipiters zinging through with Broad-winged hawks in tow.  We united under a late-day Ferruginous hawk soaring with a harrier.  We also maganged to slip a sub-adult Golden eagle in with only seconds left in the game and left the hill with residual Broad-wings overhead.  <br/>

<p>At first, we were worried that today would continue the streak of non-peak days we've been experiencing lately, but by early afternoon the birds started turning out. We got to see some intense accipiter-raven aerial brawls, a colorful adult red-shouldered hawk, and two more ferruginous hawks. The ferruginous hawks are such large, light-colored buteos that when the first one started flying in, all we could see what a white V heading towards us. We also got to witness a wedding ceremony overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge.<br/>

<p>Today was predominately filled with quiet standing, punctuated by excited bellowing.  Despite having seen only around 200 total raptors, we were treated to a speciose day.  A Ferruginous Hawk was gracious enough to entertain us and allow everyone a look through the scope.  Shortly thereafter a very golden adult Golden Eagle took a long and luxurious glide from Hill 88 to the immediate vacinity of Hawk Hill and passed on and away over the city.  We ended our day with a rainbow to the northeast.  What is on the other side of this rainbow?  Perhaps an unfathomable number of raptors pouring in for the weekend.  Good luck Saturday II.  <br/>

<p>Slow raptor day, fast everything else day!  The rain let up and the fog cleared by 10:30.  The weather only got better from there, but raptors remained few and far between.  However, with rain comes ENORMOUS NUMBERS OF TERMITES and with enormous numbers of termites comes ENORMOUS NUMBERS OF WHITE-THROATED SWIFTS (and a few Vaux's Swifts!).  They zipped and turned and they were generally unpreturbed by our presence as they winged down the termites in front of our faces.  We were also treated to a perfet southbound 'V' of White-fronted Geese, making all kinds of ruckus up in the higher altitudes.  <br/><br/>In lieu of the recent termite explosion, here are some termite facts:<br/><br/>Termites reproduce by swarming.  The swarms consist of workers that molt into reproductive, winged adults.  During this nuptial flight, most will become food for birds, frogs, lizards, and other animals.  Those that survive will become the kings and queens of future colonies.  Some scientists estimate that ants and termites combined make up more than 20% of the world's animal biomass.<br/><br/><br/>

<p>The day started off hot, humid, and slow. Wednesday II was feeling abandoned by both the raptors and our our leader as they both headed south for migration. Though we can't complain too much as we did have clear skies and good visibility till 3PM when the fog rolled in. Some of todays highlights were the inconsistant flow of sharp-shinned hawks and a very fiesty peregrine falcon, who took way too much pleasure in chasing away the less than graceful Cooper's hawks flying through it's airspace. Hopefully Thurs II will have better luck than we did, but where we managed to scoot by without getting rained on...I think you guys and gals may need your raincoats. <br/><br/>Happy hawkwatching, <br/>     Wed II  <br/>

<p>Despite the fog, we still had a very busy day on Hawk Hill. The Broad-winged Hawks are still out in strong numbers, and we even had a last minute Bald Eagle sighting as it flew through a brief gap in the fog. The highlight of the day, however, was a fight between an angry juvenile Peregrine Falcon and a pesky Raven.<br/>

<p>Apparently more than a few people woke up this morning with a hunch that today would be a good day for migration to show itself.  At 9:00 there were but four of us making our way up to Hawk Hill, but by 11:00 the number of counters had jumped to 18!  I'm sitting here and envisioning the utter chaos that today might have been had we not had so many eager raptor enthusiasts participate of their own volition!  The sky was brimming with accipiters, high and low, determined and lackadasical.  Right off the bat we had some Broad-winged Hawks soaring with Red-tailed and Cooper's Hawks in front of the Golden Gate Bridge.  The day only escalted from there, bringing us Merlins, Osprey, Red-shouldered Hawks, and a Golden Eagle!  Big birds, little birds, red birds, blue(ish) birds!  If you are not sure whether it's worth coming up to the hill in the next few days, picture this:<br/><br/>You see a bird close by and raise your binoculars.  As you are focused on the near bird, you see another rising behind it.  And another and another until you are looking at a string of birds from the Golden Gate Bridge to Mount Tam.  <br/><br/>Welcome to peak!<br/>

<p>Finally! The fog lifted a bit today and we were able to get up on the hill with a decent ceiling of clouds above us. Once we got through our first hour of hawkwatch the flow of accipiters (short rounded wings and long tailed, hawks) really opened up. We had record numbers of sharp-shinned hawks (the smallest of the accipiters) for the 2014 season today, but unfortunately no adults showed up for the party. Among some of the neater birds seen today were the great looks we got at a soaring merlin and two dark-morph broad-winged hawks! <br/><br/>Quick quiz: How do you tell a juvenile dark morph broad-winged hawk from a juvenile dark morph red-tailed hawk?<br/><br/>Anyways, it was a fun time up on the hill and six hours of standing just flew right by. Just remember to bring plenty of layers tomorrow Mon II, and good luck!<br/><br/>-Sun I out<br/>

<p>Sadly, it was another foggy day in the Marin Headlands. The team decided to meander up the Miwok Trail, where we spotted two hovering female American Kestrels and a male and female Peregrine Falcon. As we wandered closer to Hawk Hill at the rifle range we spotted a beautiful male Kestrel and a Red-tailed hawk. The fog looked as if it were about to lift, so we decided to take our chances up on hawk hill. Alas, it was not meant to be. The fog was too thick and we decided to call it a day. Hopefully this fog will lift soon and we can get back to our quadrants, counting the majestic raptors in the Marin Headlands.<br/>

<p>The fog refused to budge from its comfortable position snuggled against the hillsides anywhere in the vicinity of Hawk Hill, so we were unable to do Hawkwatch today. Instead, we took a nice walk around the lagoon and saw a pair of Peregrine Falcons, a few Red-tailed Hawks, a coyote hunting by the edge of the water, and a tree with five different warbler species all mixed together. From the edge of the Rodeo Valley Trail, we watched the fog rolling in even lower, and one of the Hawkwatchers concluded that Hawk Hill had turned into a Fog Volcano. After seeing that, we decided to call it a day.<br/>

<p>TODAY THERE WAS SOME FOG.  And then there was less fog.  And then, incredibly, there was more fog.  We went up the hill and then down the hill and then back up the hill one last time to actually count the birds and we had a glorious few hours of only mild fog.  Despite the short count time, we got our binocs on a juvenile Northern Harrier cruising in the valley to the southeast of the hill.  There was also a period of time before the fog swallowed them that both of our bridge Peregrines were sitting atop the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge, reigning over their vast and beautiful kingdom as per usual.  <br/>

<p>The activity on Hawk Hill is picking up now, with an increase in accipiter numbers as well as the early trickle of Broad-winged Hawks. We had a juvenile Northern Harrier make a few passes along the lower West slope of the hill so that we got a great view of his pumpkin-colored breast. We also got some close views of Sharpies and Cooper's Hawks to help (or confuse) us on our accipiter identification skills. Some of the non-bird-related sightings of the day included the first unicycle to make it up to Hawk Hill, and the second marriage proposal our team has witnessed so far this season. Look out for more Broadwing Hawks, Red-shouldered Hawks, and Sharp-Shinned Hawks in the next few days (unless the predicted storm keeps us off the hill).<br/>

<p>After an accipiter boom in the early morning, the raptors were replaced with cold and fog and we had no choice but to wait for them to reappear and eat cookies.  The fog had cleared by early afternoon and things started to trickle by, though the highlight was a last-minute juvenile Peregrine falcon parading its machismo and roughing up a juvenile Cooper's hawk.  We're wondering if this is the same bird as yesterday that has since acquired a taste for attention of the hawkwatchers.<br/><br/><br/>

<p>Today was a hot day, but Wed II toughed out the heat in order to see some really neat birds. Some of the more interesting species we saw up on the hill today were not actually raptors. Some time just before noon we had a flurry of acorn woodpeckers fly by Hawk Hill to the north. We also saw a purple martin and many many Vaux's swifts. Our raptor front wasn't too bad either with many more adult red-tailed hawks and our first confirmed merlin of the Hawkwatch season!<br/><br/>Keep the ball rolling Thurs II, <br/><br/>Matt<br/>

<p>After a slow start to our Hawkwatch adventure, we were surprised by a far off sighting of a Swainson's hawk (thanks to the return of hawkwatcher, Tim Behr, who has been out with a knee injury). As the hours crept on, we got an incredible view of some juvenile Northern Harriers and the crescent-shaped wing windows of a Red-shouldered hawk. By far, the highlight of the day was the first sighting of the year, of a magnifiscent Ferrugious hawk. The three points of light, the white wing patches and white tail coverts, were shining brightly in the sun as the raptor slowly flew over us. Over all it was a fantastic day full of beautiful birds and wonderful people.<br/>

<p>While the day was hawk poor, it was rich with sun and friends.  Everyone enjoyed some macadamia products and mused over the effectiveness of skywriting.  We were granted a long look at an osprey packing a lunch overhead and an extended gander at the belly of a juvenile Peregrine falcon which, after circling around for a bit, folded up and made a beeline for the city.  <br/>

<p>Move over, Saturday I because Sunday I has swept the new total sightings count and species diversity, made possible by an (almost) complete falcon sweep (Prairie, Peregrine, and kestrel) and a slew of adult Red-shouldered hawks!  We also had a close encounter of the helicopter kind which was both loud and VERY LOW.  A last-minute White-tailed kite spotted overhead tipped us up to 11 total species and there was much high-fiving to be had.  We left the hill having honored our Turkey Vultures by counting them 147 times.  Happy belated World Vulture Day!  So let's all go home and pat our sunburned backs about having the new best day of the season!  MORE TO COME?  <br/><br/> <br/>

<p>Today was brimming with both volunteers and raptors.  What began as an overcast day turned into one of glorious, unbridled, joyous sunlight.  We began this season's Hawk Talk and Banding demonstration schedule with an attentive crowd, nearby Red-tailed hawks, and the release of a freshly banded juvenile male Cooper's Hawk.  We celebrated World Vulture Day by counting 138 Turkey Vulture sightings, some as distant tipsy smudges, and others with their tomato-red naked heads not so far from ours.  One volunteer reported having heard the wind whistling through their feathers as they passed overhead. <br/><br/><br/>

<p>The day started out a little cloudy, but eventually cleared up and gave us a good day of hawkwatching that turned downright exciting at the end. We saw a mini kettle of Red-tailed hawks, watched Red-tailed pair-bonding rituals, and got some great close views of a male kestrel and juvenile Red-tailed hawks. Most exciting of all, in the last half-hour we saw two Golden Eagles and two Peregrine Falcons within the same minute.<br/>

<p>Today was an excellent skill building day. Everyone on the team had a chance to look at and try to identify a number of different exciting birds. we saw the Golden Gate Bridge Peregrines, plus an extra, and even got a few nice looks at Northern Harriers. One quadrant even got to watch a Red-tailed Hawk attacking a Northern Harrier. Perhaps the best highlight of the day, however, was the surprising number of Golden Eagles we saw over the course of the day. We watched them take their time soaring along, and got a great view of different tail molts. We also got a very early-season sighting: someone dressed as Santa Claus in the parking lot below.<br/>

<p>It was a bright and sunny day for MON I. While we did have a nearly constant W wind, our day was relatively slow. All of us were hoping to see Sat IIs prairie falcon, but we we not as fortunate. However, we did see quite a spectacle of adult red-tailed hawks defending their territory, from what I presume was a migratory adult red-tail, all of this just before we ended our count for today! It gave some of our newer hawkwatchers and visitors the opportunity to hear that iconic bald eagle scream from the commercials, that we all know is actually your local red-tailed hawk. <br/><br/>Good luck Tues II and remember to bring plenty of water and sunscreen! <br/>

<p>We kicked off the Labor Day weekend in style, with raptors aplenty, sunshine, sunburns and lots of hats being ripped off by the wind.  Truly the perfect formula for the perfect birding day.  We got a glimpse of some specks that ended up being our two large falcons--Prairie and Peregrine--and a slightly smaller speck that was our American kestrel for the day.  We looked at Red-tailed hawks from just about every angle and a juvenile Red-shouldered hawk treated us to a spectacular back-lit fly-over!  <br/>

<p>It was a gloriously sunny (and slightly breezy) day, so we had good visibility for a nice day of hawk watching. We saw four ospreys, and one white-tailed kite flew right over the hill so we could get a closer look at this "flying angel" as one of the hawkwatchers called it. However, the highlight of the day was probably the Golden Eagle that went soaring over the ridge. The biggest disappointment of the day was when we saw a Northern Harrier as we were walking up to the hill, which meant we couldn't count it.<br/>

<p>Upon summiting Hawk Hill we were immediately serenaded by a man with a ukelele and the day only got better from there!  Everyone doused themselves with sunscreen and settled in for a long day of being barraged with Red-tailed Hawks.  No matter how experienced a hawkwatcher you may be, an up-close look at the belly of a Red-tailed Hawk is a lovely sight.  We were also treated to a high-altitude boxing match between a Cooper's Hawk and a Northern Harrier.  Not sure who won, as they disappeared into the clouds.  No sight of our resident bridge Peregrines but had a few American Kestrels go whizzing by.  Still have our eyes on the horizon for the season's first Prarie.  We'll pass it to you, Monday II.

<p>Another typical day in "Fogust": We managed to get out for a couple of hours as the fog briefly lifted before the winds blew us off the hill. We practiced identifying different landmarks in the area and got very excited at every Turkey Vulture we saw. The one Red-tailed Hawk we saw spent a long time "stilling" over the slope of the hill, using an updraft to hold itself in the same position in the air while it scanned the area. Our dayleader Kim used this bird as an opportunity to explain his theory that juvenile and adult Red-tailed Hawks look different when they still because juvenile wings are thinner and have less fine control, so they end up moving their wings to stay in place, while the adults can control their position using only their wingtips. The highlight of the day for me was when I saw an American Kestrel suddenly pop up over the ridge and go zooming over the hill. Overall, not an incredibly exciting day, but definitely better than nothing.<br/>

<p>It was a somewhat slow day, but we had nice weather and pretty clouds. Winds were slow and mostly from the north. A merlin breezing by at the beginning of the count was a nice highlight, as was a close view of a dark morph juvenile red-tail. We had a great time and an unbelievable potluck for the last Tuesday II!<br/>

<p>Today started off really foggy, but we had a potluck to pass the time. Following a flash sighting of the mystical all-white Red-tailed Hawk, the fog suddenly vanished. Coincidence? I think not. Overall, we had a pretty good final day with many Red-tailed Hawk sightings and a guest appearance from a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk. The temperature started out warm, but a cool breeze picked up towards the end of the day. <br/>

<p>Today was an outstanding day because we saw an albino Red-tailed Hawk! It is completely pure white, and we followed from Mt. Tamalpais to angel Island until it finally looped back and disappeared into Sausalito. Some other perks were several Merlins, a few dark Red-tailed Hawks, and some Harriers. The weather was hot hot hot hot December and the skies were clear.<br/>

<p>Today was a beautiful day on Hawk Hill but unfortunately there were not many raptors. There was little to no wind with temperatures ranging from 64-75 degres Fahrenheit. With only 6 species we didn't see anything too spectacular although we had some great views of Wren tits and White-throated swifts. All in all this was a great season for the Saturday I team!<br/>

<p>It was unseasonably warm for this late in November, with temperatures almost reaching 80 degrees fahrenheit in the afternoon. Accompanied by nearly 500 visitors, we enjoyed the diversity of raptors seen from the hill today, including the turkey vultures (coming out on top with 113), red-tailed hawks (second with 101), and a smattering of late-season accipiters. Of course, I am contractually obliged to mention the juvenile bald eagle we watched circling over the lagoon (accompanied by five turkey vultures) as well as that awesome moment where we saw three dark-morph adult red-tails in the sky at the same time.<br/>

<p>Another slow, tail-end-of-the-season-type of day on Hawk Hill, with winds picking up speed throughout the day and temperatures in the 50's. The raptor highlight of the day was a beautiful adult peregrine falcon, giving us a great look as it circled in Kirby Cove. The non-raptor highlights include ravens playing with sticks, the interns' inventions of new hawk species (including the yellow-headed aplomado ferruginous-backed falcon and the American gyrvulture), and a delicious potluck feast by all of the volunteers. Thanks for a great season, Tuesday I!<br/>

<p>Today begain with similar windiness to the previous two days, but the winds died down after the first couple of hours and we had a sunny, clear day on the hill. In the morning we had pretty steady red-tail activity, but the count slowed significantly in the afternoon, with only 52 birds in the final hour and a half. In the words of some hawkwatchers, we found ourselves "dredging" for birds. Nonetheless, 366 raptors is a pretty good count for this late in the season, especially when accompanied by an assortment of dark chocolates.<br/>

The team got a good look at a juvenile Rough-legged Hawk during the first hour, as well as an adult Peregrine Falcon that was almost close enough to touch. Other raptors of note include a Golden Eagle and four dark morph Red-tails, three juveniles and an adult. Migratory Varied Thrushes and American Robins were also spotted in the AM.<br/>

<p>You know it's a day to remember when you overhear long-time hawkwatchers discussing whether or not this is "the slowest migration-season day ever." By the time noon rolled around, we had counted a measly 22 raptors, only three different species. The afternoon winds brought us some nice diversity, however, including an osprey flying across the ocean, and a juvenile Swainson's hawk flying south through the city. We ended the day with a respectable species count of 10, and a total count of 98 raptors, 16.33 hawks per hour. Thankfully, the ravens stepped up to keep us entertained today, performing great feats of balance on the wire fence in the south quadrant.<br/>

<p>Today started out with a bang! We saw an adult female Rough-legged Hawk in Kirby cove and 3 Peregrine Falcons! Unfortunately the flight tapered down throughout the day and we ended up with a 36 Hawks-per-hour total rate of sightings. The aforementioned species were definitely the highlights of the day, though we had a few nice male American Kestrel sightings. The weather was in the 60's and 70's all day with moderate wind at the beginning and end of the day.<br/>

We saw two Northern Harriers flying together and did some acrobatics in the air. The sky was clear and the high was 78, with moderate to low wind all day long.<br/>

<p>Today was a beautiful day on the hill with great visibility and slow winds. The temperature was netweem 65 and 70 degrees all day and the wind direction was all over the spectrum. We had 12 species today including a White-tailed Kite, a Ferruginous Hawk, and another Rough-legged Hawk! Most of our birds were fairly far away, but we did get a semi-close look at a Peregrine and a few American Kestrels to end the day. <br/>

<p>It was a nice clear day today, with north/northeast winds. The morning and late afternoon were relatively slow, but we had a flurry of red-tails coming through the valley towards the middle of the day. These included quite a few beautiful dark morph adults, and one rufous morph. We also got to see three ferruginous hawks, including the first adult of the season! The adult came very close right into Kirby Cove. We also had a nice look at a rough-legged hawk over the lagoon. <br/>

<p>It was a beautiful day, with great species diversity. Conditions were clear with a light breeze. Red-tails and turkey vultures trickled through slowly but steadily. Accipiter activity has slowed down, but we enjoyed two excellent highlights- a subadult (most likely fourth year) bald eagle passed over Angel Island and allowed great views. Its head was almost completely white, and the tail was white with brown inner rectrices. We also had nice looks at a rough-legged hawk, which was either an adult female or a juvenile. <br/>

<p>Monday I had an eventful day on the hill. Between our sightings of a juvenile Swainson's Hawk above the FM towers and a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk on the Slacker area, we saw an adult Peregrine Falcon chase away a Merlin. Red-tails were certainly here in a fair number, though accipiters have been slowing down. It was sunny and warm all day, with a slight wind in the morning which mellowed down as the day went on.<br/>

<p>Friday I reporting the highest HPH so far this season! The morning started out with blustering winds over 20mph, but these died down significantly as the day progressed. In other weather news, it was clear overall and sunny. Some highlights of the day were seeing a very close juvenile Ferruginous Hawk and White-tailed Kite. Red-tailed Hawks were in the house in huge numbers as well. It was a great day and a great learning opportunity for the team!<br/>

<p>There was very nice species diversity and beautiful weather today. Red-tails came through steadily throughout the day, and there was a high count of merlins. Highlights included a fair number of dark morph red-tails, one dark morph broad-winged hawk, and a "gray ghost" (adult male harrier). We thought all of this was quite fitting for Halloween. :) At the end of the day we also spotted a distant golden eagle.  <br/>

<p>Today we didn't see our first hawk until 38 minutes into the count, but the long wait was validated as a Prairie Falcon flew by a few minutes later. Visibiltiy was great throughout the day with temperatures in the high 60's and slight winds from the ESE. Like yesterday, we saw a large number of ravens, but we also saw all four falcons! A first time feat for this season. Otherwise highlights of the day include great company, lots of sun, and a very light Peregrine flying to Kirby Cove. <br/>

<p>Today's ravenwatch team had a great time watching, identifying, and counting ravens. While we were watching all of these ravens, we occasionally noticed a hawk and counted that too. In fact, we counted 278 hawks, many of which appeared to fall out of the clouds overhead. Highlights of the day include a raven barreling through the sky, a peregrine falcon harassing two Northern harriers, a raven playing with sticks, a distant ferruginous hawk, a kettle of ravens, a beautiful adult red-shouldered hawk, and a raven that kept saying, "hawk! hawk!"<br/>

It seemed like a fairly average flight, with American Kestrels as the most notable species sighted. The temperatures were low and the wind almost blew us off the hill by the end of the day...the plethora of hoods, scarves, and beanies--along with the screaming wind--made it a little difficult to hear each other's calls.<br/>

Red-tailed Hawks were the stars of the show today, totalling 139.<br/><br/>If you've been waiting to come to Hawk Hill for a docent program and banding demo, tomorrow is your last chance!

<p>Another foggy morning, but Wednesday II was not about to have their hopes of hawkwatching dashed. We followed the trend of the previous days and took a walk around Rodeo Lagoon this morning, seeing a number of sparrows, warblers, and waterfowl. Highlights include a pair of Wilson's snipes and a Bonaparte's gull. Around noon, we headed up to Hawk Hill and spent the next 2.25 hours counting. Through the fog, we counted some large kettles of Red-tailed Hawks, with the occassional accipiters thrown in. By 1:30, we were pretty much completely enshrouded again. With patches of visibility coming and going, we continued counting what we could see until we finally called it quits at 2:30.<br/>

There was a flurry of activity as the fog cleared, including some kettles of red-tails and turkey vultures. There was a nice flow of accipiters as well. Also of note- during the fogged-in morning, we had some great bird sightings around the lagoon. Highlights included Wilson's snipe, fox sparrow, pectoral sandpiper, black-bellied plovers, ring-necked duck, ruddy duck, horned grebe, and golden- and ruby-crowned kinglets. To top it off, we ran into a bobcat eating a dead deer at the edge of the lagoon. <br/>

Out on the beach, the highlight was a pair of Surf Scoters. We got up to the annex just in time to see some clearing there, but Hawk Hill stayed obscured in typical fashion until it was time to leave.

<p>Today flight was slow and mostly speck birds, but Saturday I pushed through and counted them all! The weather was warm with slight winds, though not enough to push more birds out way it seems. We did get a decent amount of adult accipiters though, and many of our team members were able to work on accipiter ID.<br/>

<p>Todays flight picked up at around 10:30 AM and stayed pretty consistent throughout the day. The weather was in the 70's and a light breeze picked up towards the end of the day. The highlight of the day was a leucistic adult Red-tailed hawk! It had brilliant white shoulders, but was otherwise normal and hung around the Slacker area for at least 5 minutes. We also saw a good deal of Merlins and Northern Harriers, including an adult female, which is a rarity on Hawk Hill!<br/>

<p>What happened to peak season? Today was unsually slow for this time of year, and we found ourselves looking at ravens or empty skies for most of the day. We did get a few goods views of some birds though, for example, several Red-shouldered Hawks, accipters, a Broadwinged Hawk, and a Purple Martin. Overall the weather was a little muggy, with low cloud cover and intermittent fog. We hope for more birds next time!<br/>

<p>Today finally started to feel like peak (for about and hour)! The day started off quite slow, similar to how it has been all week, but we had a sudden flood of accipiters around 1:30 PM. Another highlight was seeing a Merlin fighting in the sky with a juvenile Sharp-shinned Hawk and then shooting over the top of the hill.

Still very few raptors, however.

<p>It was a slow day today, despite the fact that late September is typically peak migration. Many turkey vultures were moving through, some in large kettles. A golden eagle subadult passed close to the hill, and we also got great views of a prairie falcon. Despite the slowness, these were some fun highlights!<br/>

In early afternoon, winds picked up a bit and we began to see more accipiters and other raptors. We had a great view of a subadult bald eagle which flew over from Hill 88, and had two broad-winged hawks pass close to the hill. A prairie falcon also zipped by late in the day.<br/>

<p>Another sunny day on Hawk Hill with temperatures in the 70's and a light wind coming from the west. We saw a lot of accipiters today, 28 Sharp-shinned Hawks and 41 Cooper's Hawks. To the great delight of the many hawkwatchers on the hill today (184 visitors on a Wednesday...maybe had something to do with the America's Cup final...), we also got some good looks at a Golden Eagle (subadult), a Ferruginous Hawk (juvenile), and two more Broad-winged Hawks. As usual, there were Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vulutres apleanty, and towards the end of the day, a Raven carrying a peanut-butter and jelly sandwhich was sighted as well.<br/>

<p>Today was slow at the start, slow at the finish, with a flurry of raptor activity in the middle. The day was sunny and the wind direction was "all," seeming to change every three minutes or so. We were hopeful to get a look at the vagrant Blue-footed Booby, spotted just across the bay at 10AM today (thank you, eBird!) However, the raptors certainly kept our attention today. We got a good look at a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk, followed by an even better look at its adult counterpart, a great lesson in distinguishing the two. Towards the end of the day, a distant dot was identified as a Ferruginous Hawk of unknown age. As for our usual suspects, the Turkey Vulutures beat out the Red-tailed Hawks by one bird today, 94-95.<br/>

This, however, was trumped and made to seem mundane by our 2:20 PM sighting of A DARK-MORPH FERRUGINOUS HAWK! The Ferruginous Hawk came in from Mt. Tamalpais with a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk and flew lazily over our heads, giving us a GREAT view.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a great and fog-free day.

<p>The team had great weather and great birds today, with three falcon species and 2 Broad-winged Hawks!  One Broad-wing flew directly overhead, giving the team a great look.  They also watched several Sharp-shinned Hawks going after Cooper's Hawks - feisty accipiters tussling in the sky made for a good show. Docent programs continue this weekend, with noon Hawk Talks and 1pm Banding Demos on both Saturday and Sunday - be sure to leave plenty of time to park and walk up if you plan to attend, as parking is limited and fills up fast. Lots of non-raptors are moving through too - visit the Visitor's Center to pick up a map if you'd like to park and hike up while birding! <br/>

<p>We got up to the hill and started our count at 11 o'clock sharp this morning and got in a solid 4.5 hours of counting despite the fog creeping in and out throughout the day. The highlights: we caught a glimpse of the first Merlin of the season, a good look at an adult dark-morph Red-tailed Hawk, and a few adult accipiters. The weather stayed relatively warm, and overall, we had quite a pleasant day. <br/>

<p>It was a relatively slow day today demonstrated by our brief celebration at 3:00 when the count reached 100 raptors. Overcast with a light breeze, we mostly saw the usual: Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures (no Cooper's Hawks counted today!). There was some nice movement of non-raptor migrants ("tweety birds" as some hawkwatchers call them) to keep us occupied as well, including flocks of 23 White-throated Swifts, 20 Band-tailed Pigeons, and 15 Cedar Waxwings.<br/>

<p>We got up to the hill this morning around 9:45 this morning, breaking above the thick layer of fog to find a beautiful sunny hill from which to conduct our count. The lack of wind for most of the morning may have contributed to a slightly slower morning, but when it finally picked up around noon, the Red-tailed Hawks started to arrive en masse, teasing us in several large, shifting kettles that bounced back and forth for several hours between the West and the South quadrants. We also got a good long view at a Prairie Falcon that came out of the North and took off south across the Golden Gate. The fog chased us off the hill just before 2 pm, when we ended our count and packed up for warmer climes. It should be noted, however, that we did have great views of the Mt. Diablo fire while the sky was open. <br/>

From 1 to 2 pm we counted a large group of eleven redtails circling together, and a total of 41 redtails during this hour! Three dark morph redtails were spotted today. One unidentified falcon appeared to be a possible merlin based on its shape and flight behavior. <br/>

<p>We thought that today was going to be a scorcher but the wind picked up around 1 to make it a beautiful day up on Hawk Hill. The high was 88 degrees with great visibility that lasted all day. The highlight was the two Golden Eagles (1 subadult and 1 juvenile) that flew by within minutes of each other. We saw our usual plethora of Red-tailed hawks and Turkey vultures, but we were also lucky enough to see 2 Osprey, a couple of Northern Harriers and a few kestrels. Saturday II is proud to now hold the season record of raptors per hour at 53.4!<br/>

<p>Friday I is proud to announce the first eagle sighting of the season: a juvenile Golden Eagle soaring around the North and South Slacker peaks! It hung around long enough for everyone to look at it through a spotting scope if they so pleased, and boy, we were pleased! We also got some great up-close and personal views with an osprey and a dark morph adult and juvenile Red-tailed Hawk. Overall it was a beautiful. clear, and hot day on the hill. Indeed peak is on its way, and we are getting giddy!<br/>

<p>It was a beautiful, clear day with some great sightings! Many red-tails and turkey vultures passed, with a good number of accipiters. These included both Cooper's hawks and sharp-shinned hawks. We also saw a few red-shoulders, kestrels, peregrines, an osprey, and two prairie falcons! This was certainly the highlight of the day - we saw some great stooping behavior from one of the birds before it flew up over Hawk Hill and stilled for a moment. This allowed us to have excellent views of the bird!<br/>

<p>It's hard to say what was more exciting for the hawkwatchers today: spotting the first Broad-winged Hawk of the season (a second-year showing significant molt and a mixed tail), the dark-morph Broad-wing that puzzled us for nearly a half-hour, the 3 dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks that flew by between 12 and 2, or the 58 Turkey Vultures (okay, it probably wasn't the vultures). With clear skies, temperatures consistently in the 70's, and the great company of Wednesday I hawkwatchers, today was ideal. Additional highlights include an Osprey flying low below the Golden Gate Bridge and a Cooper's Hawk and Sharp-shinned Hawk flying together to offer apprentice watchers a chance easily to compare the two species. We hope today was indicative of the great migration season to come!<br/>

<p>Despite it being another thoroughly foggy day on the hill, the Monday 1 team pushed through and counted for a few hours anyway. In the clear windows between sheets of fog, we were able to see up to 5 juvenile Red-tailed Hawks at once within a single binocular field. We also picked up a single juvenile Cooper's Hawk in the distance. There has been talk of a few early Sharp-shinned hawk sightings in the valley, so we are excitedly waiting for our chance to count them from the hill!<br/>

<p>PEA SOUP. Eventually went up to the Annex to see if we could wait out the fog on the hill, but visibility wavered between poor and dismal and we really only caught glimpses of two juvenile Red-Tailed Hawks and a few Turkey Vultures. Allen began an informal Hawk Talk for the crew down at the Annex and twice managed to mistakenly write on his dry-erase board with a permanent marker--definitely a highlight of the day. Good conversation, pleasant enough weather, but no birds.<br/>

<p>Saturday II arrived at the annex just below Hawk Hill at 11:00 this morning to be greeted by a thin layer of fog. Optimistic of its eventual clearing, we birded for a couple hours, getting looks at a couple accipiters, numerous turkey vultures, and an adult red-tailed hawk making territorial swoops on a raven right over our heads. By 1:00, the fog on Hawk Hill had only managed to get thicker, so we had to call off the count for the day.<br/>

About 10% of the raptors we counted today were perched, but we did have some nice fly-overs: an adult Peregrine falcon towards the end of the day and a juvenile Red-tail with a leucistic section of primary feathers.

<p>Lovely sunny day with mild winds and temps in the high 60's.  Decent flight for the time of year, of course much slowed down.  A late prairie falcon was gracious enough to visit!  It was a gorgeous day for the last Monday of the season.  Until next time!<br/>

<p>The rain continues and sadly the Saturday I team was unable to count hawks today. We did enjoy some breakfast treats and good company before calling it quits. Great season Saturday I team! And I certainly hope this rain stops soon...<br/>

<p>Weird day for weather starting with pouring rain, transitioning into sunshine, and ending with fog. The team enjoyed delicious treats during the morning. Once the rain cleared, we marveled at a large flock of brown pelicans on the lagoon before heading up to the hill. We had a slow 2 hours of counting before fog (and some boredom) brought us back down. <br/>

<p>Nice day for our last Tuesday I; patchy clouds and occasional wind with some nice sun.  Plenty of red-tails still out there, accipiters have fallen off drastically, and we're still keeping eyes out for exotic northern birds like rough-legged hawks and ferruginous hawks!  We got to end our day by watching the telemetry crew release their newest bird, a juvenile male red-tail hawk called Echo.  Best luck to them!<br/>

<p>Such a beautiful day on the hill with more raptor activity than we've seen in quite some time! Steady winds from the North/West throughout the day brought a steady stream of Red Tailed Hawks, more Accipiters than we've seen in a day for a few weeks, and great views of both a Ferruginous and a Rough Legged Hawk. A juvenile Peregrine Falcon just outfitted with a GPS backpack transmitter was released from the top of the hill at the end of the day - a map on which you can follow her travels will be on the GGRO website in a few days! <br/>

<p>It was a busy and gusty Black Friday on Hawk Hill with lots of visitors taking advantage of the holiday. It appears that the hawks enjoy all the deals of Black Friday as well, as there were 286 sightings (respectable for late November). A hungry merlin had a snack on the wing right in front of north quadrant and with only a few minutes left before closing time a beautiful juvenile golden eagle passed by the hill! We enjoyed a hawks per hour rate of 47.7 - all around a fun day of hawk counting!<br/>

<p>The Hill was fogged in when we arrived at 10 but cleared around 11:30. Most birds seemed to be flying relatively high in the sky. There were a number of dark morphs sighted, including a few Red-tails and a Rough-legged Hawk! The banding team trapped a large Red-tail that Chris attached a GSM Transmitter to and released at Hawk Hill after giving everyone a good look. Turned out to be a productive day after a not-so-promising start.<br/>

<p>Went up to the hill in rather ominous weather, counted some turkey vultures and a few adult red tailed hawks fighting the wind that was gusting up to 25 miles per hour. We were struggling to hold our binoculars steady enough to see hawks through them! Then it started to rain on our rather sparse bird parade, so we called it a day after only 45 minutes of counting. Better luck next time....<br/>

<p>Despite a valiant effort on the part of the volunteer hawk watchers, there was no hawk counting done today. First it was the rain, which sent the banders home. But even after the rain subsided, thick fog remained. Blue sky hung tantalizingly close, and yet the soupy fog hung over hawk hill the entire day. <br/>

<p>I seem to have used the word 'slow' in yesterday's post excessively, without knowing what was to come today! The fact that we made it up to the hill for a full 4 hours was extraordinary considering the forecast and the rain events that did bookend our day. We counted almost as many species as we did hawks per hour, with most of our diversity seen in the very first hour (when there was warm sun on our backs!) Highlight of the day was a close adult peregrine with a very light silver back, leading us to believe this wasn't one of the local adults we usually see. Also, lots of time to look at a Merlin that perched on a rock right by the hill. <br/>

<p>Today was probably the windiest day I have ever spent on Hawk Hill with gusts reaching 25 mph! The wind did add some level of entertainment however with ravens performing acrobatics and sharp-shinned hawks being flung around like rag dolls. Raptors did brave the wind as we had 261 sitings (HPH 43.5). The highlights of the day were a juvenile ferruginous hawk (at a distance) and an up close encounter with a rough-legged hawk! A nice merlin also gave us some good looks as well. <br/>

<p>"That's the best view I've ever gotten of a _____" was a phrase used a lot of times on Hawk Hill today! The blank was filled in with various excellent raptor sightings including a Rough Legged Hawk, a Swainson's Hawk, Peregrine Falcon, and most intriguing of all, a Dark Morph Rough Legged Hawk. Not only did we see these birds, but we saw them well - not the more typical "speck" sightings of these species that are "exotic" by our standards. Ask any Saturday II team member about this day and they'll brag about the 3 Rough-Legged Hawks and the 2 Swainson's hawks happily. Otherwise, a fairly ordinary and sunny day, with much more activity in the morning than the afternoon, but some good late-day Merlin sightings kept us entertained. <br/>

We were rewarded for our efforts with 152 sightings including a close up encounter with an adult male Northern harrier and a juvenile ferruginous hawk.

<p>Very nice day on the hill, though hot hot hot with a strange haze in the air. The heat didn't seem to slow the hawks down = we had a very busy morning with 120 hawks counted in the 11-12 hour! The flight slowed down in the afternoon, though there were still a notable number of Peregrines, Merlins and Northern Harriers counted. Just when things slowed to a late day trickle and we started to get bored...an adult Ferruginous hawk and a Rough Legged Hawk came by one after another, both on the same line crossing the bay into Berkeley! Such was the conversion from sheer quantity into quality for our hawk sightings. <br/>

<p>Today was a day of falcons with 14 merlin sightings and 16 peregrine falcon sightings including a beautiful dark merlin of the subspecies suckleyi (full latin: Falco columbarius suckleyi). Additionally, an amazingly close rough-legged hawk gave the east quadrant some incredible looks further adding to the excitement of the day. The sky stayed clear, the sun shined all day, and a nice cool breeze brought frequent raptor visitors. All in all, the hawkwatchers left the hill smiling and satisfied.<br/><br/>Total sightings: 414<br/>HPH: 69<br/>Number of species: 10<br/>

Good numbers of Harriers, Merlins, and Red-Tailed Hawks. Oh and our first bird counted for the day was a White Tailed Kite!<br/>

<p>It was a slow and miserable day on hawk hill today. Even though we had fair visibility, the wind picked up as the day went on making conditions cold and unbearably slow. We did get one very nice look at a juvenile Northern Harrier while the rest of the day was filled with Turkey Vultures and Ravens. <br/>

<p>East winds started the day, changing to SE, then West.  Fog kept us company throughout the day sweeping over the Headlands and over the mid-Bay at day's end, just in time to watch GAME FOUR in Detroit.  Why today was special: the double eagle!  Subadult Bald at 12 noon; Adult Golden between 2 and 3 pm.  Clearly this portended the Giants' sweep of the Series.  But if Pablo is a Bald Eagle, and Timmy a Kestrel, what raptor species is Barry Zito? That's right! A Peregrine!<br/>

<p>Two rough legged hawk sightings! Both birds visible only int he scope and flew from Tam junction to slacker ridge, giving us just a few flashes of their signature dark carpal patches. They turned heads all across the hill. So did the Merlins, White Tailed Kites, and several juvenile Peregrine Falcons. Otherwise a steady day on the hill with hot sun and plenty of our staple birds to keep us busy and entertained. The hill was busy with visitors but we weren't totally swamped on the occasion of the GGNRA's 40th anniversary, thankfully. <br/>

<p>Finally, a full and beautiful day of birding on hawk hill! It stayed sunny and clear all day with a light wind shifting between NW and SE. We saw all the normal suspects including 3 Merlin sightings. But the highlight of the day, by far, were the 3 Golden Eagle sightings, the second of which brought this magnificent bird right past the hill as it headed out over the water towards Chrissy Fields. It was a stunning view! It was nice to see a little boom of activity after a few slow and dreary days.<br/><br/>Total sightings: 302<br/>HPH: 50.3<br/>Number of species: 10<br/>

<p>Quite drippy in the morning, once the sun peeked out we got on the hill at 10:30 to find very very slow skies and cold eastern winds. Our patience and diligent counting of Turkey Vultures and a few Red-Tails & Accipiters finally paid off, as the late afternoon clearing of the skies brought more birds. We knew the day had turned around when a Merlin flew low and close over our heads. Other interesting sightings included: adult male & female Northern Harriers, some close views of adult Peregrines (probably our Golden Gate bridge resident pair,) and even an afternoon kettle of juvenile redtails, a harrier, and sharpies circling right above us!<br/>

<p>As variable winds predicted a storm the next day, Sunday 1's hawk count got a good range of Redtails, accipiters, and Redshoulders.  Highlights included a mid-day Ferrug, an afternoon adult Golden Eagle, a steady flow of near-hourly Merlins, and... a Hawk Hill marriage proposal.  Nope, it was no-one we knew, but hopefully sanctioned by the raptors nonetheless.<br/>

<p>We were almost sure that we'd get fogged out today so we headed to Tennessee Valley for some early morning hawk watching (we were lucky enough to see an adorable bobcat on our way out). As luck would have it, when we returned to the home front around 11 the fog showed signs of weakening! The team scurried up the hill and stumbled, disbelieving, into a beautiful and busy day of hawk watching. It was a good day for Northern harriers, White-tailed kites, and Merlins but the biggest treat of the day was a gorgeous juvenile Ferruginous hawk that flew close enough to hawk hill to give us all an incredible look. <br/><br/>Total sightings: 363<br/>HPH: 96.8<br/>Total species: 12<br/>

We wandered around and saw Eared & Western Grebes, Sparrows (Fox, Lincoln's, and White-Crowned,) Ruddy Ducks and many Coots were spotted on Rodeo lagoon and the Miwok Trail. The sun finally started to break through the skies above Ft. Cronkhite around 1, complemented by an appearance by our resident pair of Kestrels, but Hawk Hill remained in a haze.<br/>

<p>This was yet another mixed-up wind direction day starting with NW flipping to East by mid day, and ending with strong 8 to 10 mph winds from the South by 3 pm.<br/><br/>The count yielded strong numbers of Redtails, and moderate numbers of small accipiters with a few adults thrown in the batch.  An early afternoon Swainson's Hawk came south for a look-see then disappeared toward Mt Tam.  A mid-day Common Poorwill was flushed from beneath a coffeeberry bush in the new restoration area and gave us a quick look as it dodged to the east side of the Hill.  Nice to know our new coastal grasslands support such provacative native birds.  A late day pair of kekking and circling adult Peregrines kept the hawkwatchers dazzled and awake at day's end.<br/>

<p>Beautiful day on the hill, with consistent visibility the entire 6 hours (a concept foreign to me thus far). The count started off a little slow, with the bulk of the accipiters not appearing until the 11-12 hour. Still, we did record an adult Harlan's Hawk, distinctive from a dark morph Red-tail with it's sooty black underside (as opposed to a chocolatey brown) and a tail devoid of red pigment with a dark subterminal band. We also watched a Humpback whale blowing water a distance off the coast in the West quadrant. It was a great day on the hill, if a tad warm at times!<br/><br/>

It was a fairly slow day for the most part, picking up every now and then on the North and East quadrants.

<p>FINALLY the action has returned to hawk hill! The hawks were celebrating the excellent weather along with all of the hawkwatchers. This was fortunate because the hill was mobbed with visitors with high expectations: friendly local birders and a few Audubon groups, and other GGRO friends. It seems unlikely that any of them left disappointed.  The Ferruginous Hawks were spectacular and numerous: flying right by the hill and giving us great views from all angles. We saw an amazing number of White Tailed Kites, and a few Broad Winged Hawks are still trickling through. Another big treat was a chance to watch an Adult Red Tailed Hawk eat a freshly caught snake on the wing while stilling extremely close to the north quadrant platform. The banding demonstration had an unexpected finale of a fly-over by a Ferruginous Hawk, White Tailed Kite and two Juvenile Red-Tailed Hawks above the platform just after we released a newly banded Cooper's Hawk. Our only disappointment was falling one species short of a 6-Buteo Day - we hoped yesterday's Rough-Legged Hawk sighting would repeat - but we had to settle for only five (including a Swainson's Hawk!) But it's pretty hard to complain after a day like today...<br/>

<p>A cold, between-storms day near the season's peak should have garnered more accips and redtails, but a steady west wind and occasional drippiness probably kept the smart hawks from flying.  But what we missed in quantity was made up for in quality.  Around 1030, a Short-eared Owl swept over Hawk Hill and flew through Kirby Cove.  About the same time, a Humpback Whale appeared in the Golden Gate, and since fin-waves and blows weren't the great critter breached a half dozen times.  On and off views of the whale continued off of Kirby Cove and out toward Pt Bonita cover until 130 pm or so.  Spectacular.  And then there was the lone hawk, being dogged by a raven over Rodeo Lagoon at about 130 pm.  Closer and closer they came until we realized we had a rough-legged hawk, the first documented roughleg of the season, and a week earlier than our earliest record here.  The day was capped with views of two merlins, one banded by our talented banders.  Wishing similar quality to the weekend teams.<br/>

<p>Cloudy, cold day and few birds in the sky... a bit of a let down after this team's great experience two weeks ago (the first big Broad-Wing day!) Insight, we were the first team in the past two weeks to not see a Broad-Winged hawk. Things got so sparse that we were excited to see the usually common Red-Tailed Hawks, and by the end of the day, even a Turkey Vulture was a very welcome sight in the empty sky! High point of the day was when an adult Peregrine falcon made a nice flight circling the hill for all to see. The fog rolled in around 3 and we called it quits a little early to go warm up!<br/>

<p>Great day today!  Had lots of good looks at birds like a ferruginous hawk, merlins and peregrines; numbers were high with several adult Cooper's hawks.  We had excitement with one unidentified bird that came through giving mostly rear-end/dorsal looks and which was highly disputed.  Fun was had by all who saw filling out rare-bird forms, but our hybrid golden eagle/ rough-legged hawk was left unidentified due to failure to come to a consensus.  It is still a little early for rough-legged hawks, but it isn't out of the realm of possibility so keep your eyes peeled!  <br/>

<p>We enjoyed a solid 13 species day up on the hill (not counting the stealth bomber and blue angels that paid us visits throughout the day). Fortunately, the hill was not overrun by eager fleet week watchers and the weather stayed sunny and clear for everyone! We had a total of 487 sightings with a hawks per hour value of 81.1. The resident pair of peregrine falcons came by close to give us a few great looks while a single golden eagle kept its distance. <br/>

<p>14 species day! It was great to have the flight pick up again today, as the winds and weather seemed to be in our favor. A beautiful and busy morning gave way to some clouds and fog, but once it cleared again in the afternoon the activity went up again. Spotted a distant Bald Eagle, and a Ferruginous Hawk flew right over with the sun blazing through its bright white feathers. Speaking of rather white birds, there are still quite a few Broad-Winged hawks flying through and many were passing over the bay today. Adult accipiter sightings continue to rise - 7 adult Cooper's Hawks were counted today. A fun day on the hill for sure! <br/>

<p>After the fog rolled in yesterday it was a great surprise to find that hawk hill was below the clouds and fog this morning! It was a little cold and windy, but we had decent visibility throughout most of the day. The flight was slower, but we still got some excellent looks at a peregrine falcon, an adult red-shoulder, and some broad-winged hawks. Our day was capped nicely with some sunshine and views of two dark-morph broad wings in sight at the same time! <br/>

<p>What a difference a day makes! The team hiked up to Hawk Hill, ice water cooler in hand, sporting shorts and t-shirts only to discover a ferocious wind making for a cool but sunny day. There was a total of 364 sightings with a hawks per hour value of 76.7. The big sighting of the day was a juvenile bald eagle who flew by the hill and gave us some nice looks. A second was sighted over towards Sausalito at a distance. Our day was cut short by a very abrupt fog intervention! Hopefully it'll clear out tonight for tomorrow's team...<br/>

<p>Today was incredibly hot up on the hill with temperatures reaching 96 around noon! Although the number of birds seemed to have dwindled from peak days, we had a record-breaking species count for the season of 14. Golden Eagles, a Ferruginous, and Broad-wings helped us reach that record along with the usual suspects. Also of note were sightings of two Black Swifts. All in all, an exhausting but good day on the hill. <br/>

<h2><a name='20120929'/>Saturday, September 29, 2012</h2>
<p>Absolutely wonderful day on Hawk Hill! The fog cleared at 11 A.M. to reveal the kettles of broad-winged hawks still circling. Unlike Thursday, the birds seemed to have consolidated into a single roving kettle, in which 55 broad-wings were counted at one point! The massive kettle had closer to 80 birds when including the Red-Tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures and a few Accipiters that had joined the group. These birds circled beside the bridge but didn't make the leap across the bay, probably due to the looming fog beneath them.<br/><br/>Other highlight of the day: a banding team caught a Broad-winged hawk in the morning that was affixed with a transmitter and released from the hill in front of a thrilled crowd. The Telemetry team will be chasing this hawk, named Lakota, down to the Mexican border over the next few days! After release,  Lakota retreated to a coyote bush just on the edge of the hill, giving the voracious photographers even more opportunities to take shots of our superstar of the day. A map on which you can track Lakota's flight should be available on the GGRO website soon! <br/>

<p>Today was an incredibly anti-climactic fog out! The Friday II team arrived bright-eyed and ready for a busy day of raptor counting (not to mention with high hopes for another big broad-winged day) only to be let down by some very thick and lazy fog. Credit must be given to these dedicated hawk watchers though! A day of fog is officially scrapped at 1:00 pm and yet members of the team persisted until 3:00 pm, ready to spring into action on a moments notice. Their dedication and optimism should be noted and praised. Let's hope the broad-winged hawks stay around a little while longer and the weekend watchers have a bit more luck!<br/>

<p>History was made today on Hawk Hill when an astounding 295 broad-winged hawks were spotted on their migration south. We had a number of large kettles (the largest of which may have been 24). Moreover, the broad-winged hawks were not shy, giving everyone in the area some great views as they rose up and around us. Among the mix were three dark morphs (1 adult and 2 juveniles). Despite our late beginning (we were SURE we'd be fogged out today) we had a total of 822 raptor sightings at a rate of 205.5 hawks per hour. <br/>

<p>We had a VERY busy day of counting today but fortunately our normal hawk watching force was joined by a whole score of visiting volunteers! 26 individuals came out to count today and I really don't know how we would've survived without them! We were visited by 662 birds today at a rate of 110.3 hawks per hour (which is still pretty mind-boggling to me, a first time watcher). Notable sitings include 27 broad-winged hawks ('tis the season!), 4 merlins, and 1 gorgeous ferruginous hawk! Of the many broad-winged hawks, one was a molting adult which was a very cool sight. We could not have asked for a more sunny, hawk-filled day!<br/>

<p>Another great day on the hill with a big crowd to join us! The morning gave us excellent views of an incredible "Gashawk", the Endeavour shuttle on display on top of a jet as it passed over the headlands and the Golden Gate. After that thrill our day was filled with exceptionally good looks at Peregrine Falcons, Broad-Winged Hawks, and Northern Harriers. The Accipiter flight was still strong and kept us on our toes until the final minutes of the day! This weekend will be a great time to visit Hawk hill during peak raptor migration, and as always there will be a hawk talk & banding demonstration from 12-1 pm on both Saturday and Sunday. <br/>

The weather couldn't have been nicer and we had lots of visitors.  Peak is here!  13 species and 726 birds made it the best day so far this year, so don't be sad, come to the hill and see birds!<br/>

<p>Big, big, BIG day on the hill today! Counted an impressive 13 species, 623 individuals, with a hawks per hour value of 103.8!! We had our fill of all the normal suspects - accipiters, red-tailed hawks, and vultures - but today they were joined by 8 peregrine falcons, 4 merlins, 6 harriers, and a white-tailed kite (to name a few). However, the REAL treat (or treats) of the day were 3 broad-winged hawks and a beautiful ferruginous hawk the latter of which payed us a visit in our last hour of counting. A truly stunning way to end the day and all 20 hawk watchers left the hill content to say the least. Let the good times roll!<br/>

<p>Today we enjoyed one of the biggest days of the season counting 493 birds with a hawks per hour value of 82!! We were graced by a number of white-tailed kites, merlins, and broad-winged hawks. A few juvenile red-shouldered hawks also gave us some good looks. Outside the world of raptors, but still notable, we saw a flock of white pelicans and three black swifts (who had temporarily disguised themselves as merlins until they flew right over head...). Beautiful, sunny, and clear day on the hill with lots of birds to keep us happy - can't complain with that now can we?<br/>

<p>The Accipiter surge is still going strong! Today brought us many great views of Sharp-Shinned and Cooper's Hawks and much practice in facing the pernicious challenge of distinguishing these two similar species. Thick fog that plagued us for almost the entire day - we didn't start counting until 11:30, had clarity in only the east quadrant until close to 2pm. Nonetheless, we still counted throughout the day and were finally rewarded with some afternoon sun!<br/>

<p>What started out as a dismal, foggy day on Hawk Hill turned into a fun and successful day of counting! Lots of very cool accipiter action in the morning as groups of sharp-shinned hawks dipped and stooped at each other through the fog. Most of the day was filled with sharp-shinned hawks, Cooper's hawks, red-tailed hawks, and turkey vultures. We were rewarded for our efforts with some osprey, a juvenile Northern harrier, and a juvenile peregrine late in the day (all at the same time, in fact)!<br/>

<p>The hawk watch team made a valiant effort on the hill today. Despite the fog we got up on the hill and braved the elements from 11:00 to about 1:20. The skies cleared for about an hour and a half during which time we saw a good amount of accipiter action as well as one white-tailed kite. Even though we were forced to quit early as the fog settled back down around the hill, it was still a fun day of watching. <br/>

<p>Today's team was fogged out and didn't make it up to the hill.  Banders reports were not promising for visibility, so we did a birding walk around the lagoon and called it a day early. While walking along the beach and lagoon we saw a number of mammals in addition to the usual birds: bottlenose dolphins, a bobcat, river otters. Bird species of the day were: Red-necked Phalarope, Greater and Lesser Yellowlegs, Yellow Warbler, Townsend's Warbler, Common Yellow Throat, Northern Rough-winged Swallow, Pacific Loon, and the vocal ID of a Great Horned Owl. In addition to a number of Turkey Vultures, we did get a good view of a Sharp-shinned Hawk as we were walking back to 1064. <br/>

<p>After a trip to the Kirby Cove lookout and a good look at a pair of Peregrine Falcons perched on the Golden Gate's north tower, team Tuesday I hopefully went up to the hill despite foggy conditions. We counted the few birds we could see for an hour and a half. Some glimpses of Accipiters let us know the hawks were flying, but identification was difficult through the fog. We hoped and hoped for clearing but the visibility only decreased and the wind picked up, so we ended our day prematurely. <br/>

<p>First merlins and first ferruginous today!!!  Fog came in and out but we had pretty good visibility for most of the day until the late afternoon.  Sharp-shinned hawks have come out in earnest, we saw 57 today.  Other birds of interest include some white-tailed kites, a few harriers, one red-shouldered hawk, and a few osprey.  3 peregrines were spotted and kestrels are still coming in strong at 22.

<p>Beautiful day on the Hill with a fair amount of birds and diversity for this time of year - mostly Redtails and Turkey Vultures, but Accipiters are beginning to come through.  One of the non-raptor highlights of the day was seeing several large "rafts" of Sooty Shearwaters between the bridge and the open ocean numbering in the thousands!  <br/>

<p>It was a beautiful day on Hawk Hill today and my first full day of hawk watching (yes, I have had extraordinarily bad luck with the fog on my hawk watch days). The day just got warmer and clearer as time passed with never really too much wind. We had a very busy morning which brushed the rust off our gears pretty quickly. Some sharp-shins and Cooper's hawks gave us good looks early in the day (which was a great learning exercise) and we also practiced gender identification with kestrels as they zipped around the hill. Plenty of red-tails (including a few gorgeous dark morphs) and turkey vultures as well. We were even visited by 2 osprey! A very fast-paced day to initiate me into the world of hawk watching (let's see if I can keep up!)<br/>

<p>Beautiful day!  First full day of the season with a total 6 hour count.  We saw good numbers of red-tails again, with some osprey and kites as well.  Not too many accipiters today, only one sharpie and a few Coops.  Kestrels weren't as numerous as in past days but we did see 12.  A few red-shoulders came through, and a couple of peregrines, and today's highlight: a prairie falcon!  Hoping to see a few more before the season is over.  <br/>

<p>Our fearless leader, Allen, brought us to the annex to wait out the fog. Sure enough, not too much later, we arrived at the top of the hill with fair visibility. Unfortunately, within twenty minutes we were completely fogged in! We optomistically waited for a miraculous clearing, but packed it up and brought our frozen selves down the hill at 1 pm. We did spend some time birding at Rodeo Beach this morning, but paid more attention to a pod of Bottlenose Dolphins frollicing in the surf, incredibly close to the surfers. We also saw Pigeon Guillemots, Surf Scoters, and a likely Pacific Loon!<br/>

<p>Today the hawk watch was fogged out sadly, but the day was not totally lost - Rodeo Beach had a visit from two bottlenose dolphins who are uncommon guests north of the Golden Gate Bridge. Additionally the lagoon was filled with phalaropes today (estimated in the hundreds though we didn't count these birds with any serious conviction). A few turkey vultures and red-tailed hawks were seen above the annex where the fog had cleared slightly by noon but again, the hill remained too foggy to do any counting.<br/>

<p>The fog appeared to be thick down at the GGRO office this morning, but the Sunday II team drove into sunshine as we approached Hawk Hill. A thick layer of fog ran low down along the bay and rodeo lagoon, but didn't stop us from counting 253 hawks, including the first Swainson's of the season! Just as we closed up at 3:30, the fog rolled into the valley, obscuring the North quadrant completely. All in all, a surprisingly good weather day, and a very good raptor day.<br/>

<p>Heading into the morning meeting the troops were sure the entire day would be fogged out. But as luck would have it, Hawk Hill cleared up around midday and I finally was able to officially hawk watch for the first time (a very exciting prospect for an intern that had already been fogged out 4 times in a row)! Conditions were fairly windy and overcast but overall visibility was swell. Two osprey sightings were probably the highlight of the day while most of our time was spent identifying turkey vultures and red-tailed hawks while practicing our communication and "bird hand offs". <br/>

The interns replaced the display of the average wingspans of the raptors of hawk hill, which can now be found on the middle platform near where the hawk watchers are normally found. <br/><br/>If this weekend brings sunny weather, it will also mark the the start of our Hawk Talk and Banding Demonstrations, which will happen on Hawk Hill every clear Saturday & Sunday at 12 pm through October. The presentations are free and there is no RSVP required. Hope to see you on the hill! <br/>

<p>The Tuesday II team had a clear day up on Hawk hill with wonderful visibility and temperatures in the 80's. We also saw our first White-tailed Kite of the season within a few minutes of our arrival! The banding team at Hawk blind captured enough raptors today to allow us to do 6 raptor ID studies. <br/>

<p>Yet another gorgeous day on the hill!  Temperatures soared up to 80 and although we had less birds today than yesterday we saw 2 additional species; one white-tailed kite and 2 northern harriers!  Other sightings included 33 turkey vultures, one osprey, 3 Cooper's, 5 red-shoulders, 60 red-tails and one glorious peregrine.  Stay tuned, we should be seeing higher numbers as we get into September!<br/>

<p>Beautiful day on the hill!  The Farallons even made an appearance on the horizon.  We had 187 sightings today, including 70 turkey vultures, one osprey, 17 Cooper's, 2 red-shoulders, 70 red-tails, 12 kestrels, and 7 peregrines.  Highlights included adult peregrines, one of which did some fantastic aerial maneuvers to head off a young red-tailed hawk.  There was a big crowd for the Sunday crew and all were glad to catch up and help train the new folk on this year's Sunday I crew.  <br/>

<p>After yesterday's brief hiatus the fog settled down on Hawk Hill once again today, preventing us from doing any counting, which was of course quite sad. We did manage to keep ourselves busy in the valley spotting some red tailed-hawks, turkey vultures, and even 2 osprey from the rifle range and a female kestrel perched on a power line from the stables. We even took a detour to the Visitor's Center and admired the diverse merchandise. With hope in our hearts, we took one quick trip up to Hawk Hill which confirmed the dismal conditions. But yesterday proved that the sun can exist in "Fogust" and so we will continue to stay positive!!!<br/>

<p>The Friday I team was thrilled to be the first to make it up to Hawk Hill this season. After an unpromising and foggy morning, bright blue sky burst through the clouds and we rushed up to the hill to begin counting. Though we experienced some more fog and wind throughout the day, the hawk count slowly rose each hour. We got especially excellent views of juvenile Red-Tailed Hawks stilling above the hill, and a few American Kestrels shooting by above our heads. Hopefully the worst of the "Fog-ust" of August is behind us and the Saturday crews will get to see the sun and some more birds tomorrow!<br/>

<p>Fogged out yet again! The Wednesday I team went for a birding walk around the lagoon, watched four Turkey Vultures pick at carrion, and spotted several Red-necked Phalaropes bobbing on the surface. We spent the remainder of the day until 1 pm at the annex with our fearsome leader, Allen Fish, optimistically hoping the fog would clear, though it soon became apparent that it was there to stay. <br/>

In the marvelous world of mammals, we glimpsed a coyote! Pleasant walk but here's to hoping hawk watch gets up on the hill soon!<br/>

<p>The final day of Hawk Watch for the 2011 season was a spectacular day up on the hill. Mostly clear skies and a gentle breeze brought a fair share of late migrants, including more than a dozen Northern Harriers. A far off Swainson's Hawk was a pleasant surprise. A number of non-raptors visited the hill as well- White-throated Swifts and Violet-green Tree Swallows showed off, keeping the Hawk Watchers on their toes with their incredible Merlin impersonations. Unfortunately, that wraps up the season without a single sighting of a Rough-legged Hawk. Hopefully we will have better luck next year! Until 2012.... this is Hawk Watch out. <br/>

<p>What a perfect way to end the season! Though the gusty winds were still present today, they weren't persistent enough to blow us off the hill. They were, however, strong enough to give us an amazing variety of birds. We ended up seeing -12- species! By noon the activity had died down, when all of a sudden, a juvenile Bald Eagle AND a partial albino adult Red-tail popped up in the south quadrant. About an hour later, a juvenile Golden Eagle was spotted in the north. The rest of the day we enjoyed seeing almost 200 Red-tails -- 2 of which were brought up to the hill by banders to be released so we could see them up close! The day ended with an Osprey flying directly overhead as we posed for a final group photo of us "hawk-upying" Hawk Hill.<br/><br/>Saturday II - you guys are awesome! Thanks for a fun season! <br/>

Volunteers were eventually blown off the hill, but while they were able to hold their optics straight they were able to see many exciting birds, including a few dark morph Red-tailed Hawks and some beautiful adult accipiters!

<p>A wonderful watch, with wicked winds wantonly winding around the hill!  While enjoying the wonderful feast orchestrated by David and Lynn Jesus, we spotted a huge number of birds for this time of year- more than the last 3 days totals combined! The Red-tails were especially productive today- and we saw lots of dark morphs, including an adult Harlan's Hawk! We also enjoyed watching the 9 Peregrine Falcons, which had no trouble in the wind even as we struggled to remain upright. Other highlights included two Red-shouldered Hawks and three Northern Harriers. What a wonderful day to end my hawkwatch season; thank you to everyone who made this year special for me! <br/>

<p>What a beautiful day to end the season for Tuesday II's team! The view from Hawk Hill was surreal - a sea of fog stretched out below us in all directions for most of the day. We could just see the tips of the Golden Gate Bridge towers and Sutro Tower resting atop the foggy ocean until around 12:30 when the fog cleared a bit and we finally saw our first birds! Though the raptor flow was very slow today, we had a wonderful potluck that kept us occupied while we watched the empty skies. Thanks for an awesome season Tuesday II!! <br/>

<p>A nice end to Monday II's adventures, even if we didn't see very many hawks. Ironically, the day started off foggy everywhere except on the top of Hawk Hill, which caused us some amusement. Hawkwatch volunteers enjoyed an assortment of pies and delighted in the great views of juvenile Northern Harriers. We also got a great look at a Merlin released from Hawk Blind. Other treats included large flocks of American Robins, a group of Western Bluebirds, and swirling columns of White-throated Swifts and Violet-green Swallows.  <br/>

<p>A blustery day on Hawk Hill with wind speed exceeding 16mph for most of the day. Fortunately some hawks blew our way with more birds than there have been lately. Highlights included an adult Red-shouldered Hawk that flew directly over volunteers as it was harassed by two Common Ravens. Thrills and chills were experienced when an adult Peregrine also flew overhead as well. Another quality sighting was a dark morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawk that flew around from the south quadrant past volunteers and into the north. An excellent way to end the season for the Saturday I Team!<br/>

The raptors didn't seem to appreciate the break from yesterday's rain, though. Numbers were low, but the day began and ended with sightings of Swainson's Hawks, which are always exciting sights to see. A handful of American Kestrels, a few Northern Harriers, and an Osprey also kept us on our toes. Let's hope the beautiful weather continues and brings with it another push of hawks later this week.

<p>Today started off warm and sunny with clear skies and wind from the northwest. The weather slowly progressed into cold and overcast with a threat of rain and strong winds from the south. Though today was slow, we still saw several Red-tails and a handful of Peregrine Falcons. The highlight of the day was seeing a couple of adult Peregrines race around Hawk Hill - one zoomed right next to the west platform and gave us a great view without binoculars. During the slower times, the Ravens kept us entertained, gathering in unkindnesses* of 12 or more and barrel rolling through the sky. <br/><br/><br/>*Unkindness: n., a group of ravens.<br/>

<p>A beautiful day on the hawkwatch, though it started out a little slow. When the winds finally came in the early afternoon, we had a huge peak of Red-tailed Hawk activity. We saw 100 juvenile Red-tailed Hawks today! One of the Red-tails that we saw was a light morph adult Harlan's type, and provided a nice challenge for the hawkwatchers. We also saw a dark morph juvenile Swainson's Hawk above Kirby Cove, which gave us a great view. We also had some very nice Peregrine Falcon sightings today, along with a lot of Northern Harriers.  <br/>

<p>A calm fall day with perfectly clear skies. Not too much raptor activity in the first half of the day, but in the last half of the day we saw an Osprey, a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk, and an adult male Northern Harrier! We also spotted a mysterious dark-backed buteo flying low over the water in the last half hour ... A kettle of 9 or so Turkey Vultures formed a couple of times to the north and Red-tails kept us entertained throughout the day. <br/>

<p>Wow, what a beautiful day on the hill! The day started out pretty rapidly with a juvenile Bald Eagle sighting as the first bird of the day. The Bald flew right over Hawk Hill and commenced soaring; an angry adult Peregrine soon joined it. Not long after, a juvenile Swainson's Hawk flew right by the hill. We had 10 species before we had completed the first hour, which might be a new record! Today was a great day for Peregrine and Merlin sightings, and we also saw quite a few White-tailed Kites and Northern Harriers. Although the hawks slowed down towards the end of the day, we were treated to another rare sight- a Golden Eagle circling by the FM towers. Definitely one of the most memorable days this season!<br/>

<p>The day started out pretty cloudy, surprisingly mostly from the east! Likewise, the wind and the birds were more numerous in the morning as well. We a got a lot of good looks at adult accipiters and juvenile Red-shouldered Hawks today, as well as a few dark morph Red-tails. One of the dark morphs, an adult, had a really interesting "tiger-barred" tail. At one point, we had three ethereal White-tailed Kites soaring together over the pines. Overall, a great day, even if it ended pretty slowly. <br/>

<p>A good late season day on Hawk Hill. Volunteers were able to see steady activity of Red-tailed Hawks and vultures in addition to a nice number of special birds including some great looks at the many Peregrine Falcons and even a couple Merlins that flew overhead and in front of the north platform! Both an adult and juvenile dark morph Red-tailed Hawks flew overhead as well, adding some excitement to the day. Other highlights included a couple close adult accipiters.<br/>

<p>Drizzling rain turned on and off throughout the day. The only birds we spotted seemed to be our local Red-tails and Turkey Vultures. Though the view is awesome from Hawk Hill when a storm is rolling in, we decided to not chance our scopes serving as lightning rods and retreated around 12:30. Stay tuned for more raptor sightings after the storm passes! .... <br/>

We did, however, see 10 Northern Harriers and got a nice view of a White-tailed Kite. A handful of Merlins and Kestrels made an appearance as well. <br/><br/>To the Thursday I team: Robyn & I had an amazing time with everyone! Thank you for all the tasty food and general awesomeness!

<p>What a beautiful day for a hawk watch- if only there were hawks! We saw a slow dribble of hawks throughout most of the day, but only 19 individuals were counted in the last hour and a half. Winds were out of the south in the morning, but switched to west, then northwest in the afternoon. Highlights of the day included two Merlins, two Red-shouldered Hawks, and two American Kestrels. Hopefully numbers will pick up before the weather takes a turn for the worse. <br/>

<p>Though it was cold and cloudy atop the hill today, the hawk watchers stayed dry for the most part. However, the raptors seemed to have forgotten to set their clocks back; numbers were low for what seemed like good conditions, with winds from the north for most of the day. We spotted a handful of White-tailed Kites, some American Kestrels, the regular Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures, and a pair of Peregrine Falcons that soared over the hill almost the entire day, wowing us with their acrobatic stunts. They even dove on an unsuspecting Red-tail, which immediately high-tailed it out of the area. With this weird weather, who knows what tomorrow will bring? <br/>

Both the adult Peregrines and adult Red-tails were observed defending their territories throughout the day. A dark ominous cloud moved toward us from Mt. Tam as we retreated from Hawk Hill, but stunning skies and great company made for a nice day. <br/>

<p>A fantastic day on Hawk Hill! Though a bit brisk with a north-westerly wind, the skies were clear allowing Hawkwatchers to see FIVE eagles, a few White-tailed Kites, and some Northern Harriers. It was also remarkable that 15 Peregrine Falcons were seen, including the bridge pair that were seen calling and defending the territory in Kirby Cove from intruding migrants! There was also a sighting of a 14th species, a Short-eared Owl that flew over volunteers ending the day with another great raptor.<br/>

A juvenile Northern Harrier blasted through the fog right over the platform, and a few Peregrine Falcons were sighted in the east including the two adults perched side by side on the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge. Though Hawkwatchers were unable to see it through the fog, Eddie Bartley of the banders reported a sighting of a Goshawk early in the day and the volunteers who returned to the office were able to see the telemetry bird, a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk, before its release this afternoon!<br/>

That wind sure did blow in some incredible bird species; sightings included an adult Bald Eagle, a juvenile Golden Eagle, and two juvenile Ferruginous Hawks. We also saw tons of Red-tailed Hawks, some of which showed very interesting color morphs. Still no sign of our first Rough-legged Hawk of the season- perhaps tomorrow will be the day!  <br/>

We had very low raptor activity at the beginning of the day, with only one ghostly White-tailed Kite seen in the first half hour! However, we did get a few treats- an adult Harlan's Hawk crossing the Golden Gate Bridge. Also, a beautiful tundrius juvenile Peregrine Falcon flew right in front of the north platform.

<p>A genuinely remarkable day on Hawkwatch! With literally dozens of falcons, 4 White-tailed Kites, 17 Northern Harriers (one of which was captured by HAWK blind and released for an ID study, the first NOHA for the banders this season) an adult Ferruginous Hawk that appeared low over the pines beyond the south and west platforms, a Broad-winged Hawk, and many more magnificent birds were seen from Hawk Hill. Megan led an educational program for a group of excited kindergarteners on the lower platform when an adult Peregrine Falcon took a tremendous stoop on a juvenile right above them- tearing through the pine trees, talons blazing, and both birds shrieking with gusto. The capstone to the day was a juvenile Bald Eagle that made an appearance right at 3:25 in the north saddle making the Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vulture in the same kettle look like accipiters. The eagle then proceeded to cross the bay into San Francisco over Crissy Field ending the day on a high note with a total of 13 species!<br/>

<p>What a beautiful day today! The morning was a little slow, but we were awed by an adult Peregrine aggressively diving and "kekking" at juvenile Peregrine over Hawk Blind. We went on to see 6 more Peregrines throughout the day, including a tundrius juvenile! We also had a great run of Merlins today, including one who gave us quite a show snacking on dragonflies. We also enjoyed watching four White-tailed Kites sail through the skies, along with some gorgeous dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks. <br/>

<p>Monday I crew was fogged off the hill again today. Birding around the lagoon, the lovely hawk watchers spotted a Common Yellowthroat, Yellow-rumped Warblers, Western Bluebirds, an American Kestrel, Western Grebes, a Ruddy Duck, and at least one hundred American Coots. Hopefully the weather will be clear atop the hill tomorrow. Stay tuned....<br/>

<p>Another beautiful day up on the hill. Winds from the east for most of the day made identifying overhead raptors a breeze (no pun intended), since many of them stalled as they passed over Hawk Hill. Highlights of the day were the four Merlins, which always manage to steal the show. We also got great looks at some adult Cooper's Hawks and adult Sharp-shinned Hawks. <br/>

<p>Another wonderful day for today's team! Clear skies with a light breeze from the NE made for a nice hawkwatching day. We saw 5 dark-morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawks - one of which was banded today and released during our 1:00 banding demonstration on Hawk Hill! We also saw 11 Merlins, 15 adult Sharp-shinned Hawks, and 13 adult Cooper's Hawks. We have been seeing a lot of diversity from Hawk Hill lately! If you're looking at the skies, look closely at any raptors you see - it may be something other than your local light-morph Red-tail or Turkey Vulture! <br/>

Along with a few Peregrines and Merlins the day went really well, with steady activity throughout the day evenly dotted with spectacular sightings of exciting species.

<p>What a spectacular day to be up on Hawk Hill! Highlights of the day included a spectacular up-close look at a dark morph juvenile Broad-winged Hawk, but even this sighting was eclipsed by a far off view of an adult Bald Eagle. We are starting to see more adult accipiters, and Merlins are still blazing through the area in high numbers, gobbling up dragonflies on their way south.  <br/>

We spotted mostly non-raptor species, including an Eared Grebe, a lone Greater White-fronted Goose, a Wilson's Snipe, a cluster of American Coots, and three River Otters. Perhaps next time the weather will cooperate for more raptor-tastic conditions.   <br/>

We also caught a glimpse of an adult male and female Northern Harrier, which was a nice identification challenge. We enjoyed watching a male Kestrel dive bombing an adult Red-tail later in the day when things were a little slow.<br/>

<p>Beautiful but hot day on the top of the hill. The morning was very busy and windy, but when the winds died down around noon and so did the corresponding numbers of hawks. However, we saw a good amount of species today. Some of our favorites were the beautiful male Northern Harrier flying high overhead, a gorgeous Osprey rising from the rifle range, and a couple of Merlins enjoying a tasty snack of dragonflies above the pines. Altogether a great day, even if we got a little sunburned!<br/>

<p>Though the morning outlook seemed bleak, Hawkwatchers took a birding hike on the Bobcat Trail and spotted several passerines including a handsome Fox Sparrow.  The afternoon cleared the skies enough to allow volunteers up on Hawk Hill, but variable fog conditions left Hawkwatch volunteers in suspense with accipiters and kestrels emerging from the swirling whiteness. The real highlight of the afternoon was the brilliant plumage of a juvenile dark morph Broad-winged Hawk!<br/>

<p>A beautiful fall day in the headlands. Unfortunately, however, no time was spent on Hawk Hill due to a persistent cloud that sat on top of the hill all day. While waiting for the cloud to blow away, we hiked down to Kirby Cove and saw a large pod of Harbor Porpoises. An Osprey was also spotted just above us. On our way back up the trail, Red-tails were being bombed left and right. First by a male American Kestrel and then another by a pair of Peregrine Falcons. <br/>

<p>The skies today were calm and peaceful. It was overcast with high clouds, yet the temperature was perfect. Though this weather was ideal for hawk watching, the hawks seemed to disagree with it and trickled through the headlands lazily. A highlight of the day was a dark morph juvenile Red-tail that circled closely around Hawk Hill twice, just to let us know a second time that he was indeed a dark morph.<br/>

<p>Today we watched the fog migrate through the Marin Headlands. We hiked around the lagoon and up Miwok trail and saw a great deal of fog. In addition to the fog migration, we saw a couple of Red-tailed Hawks - one (a rufous morph) was perched and eating lunch, and the other was diving to grab some lunch. We also heard a loud call coming from the marshy area off of Miwok trail, which we think may have been a Rail. <br/>

<p>Wow! Another gorgeous, and very hot, hawkwatch day! The team was excited to get 12 species today, with 360 total sightings. Our most common species were Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and Sharp-shinned Hawks, but we also saw quite a few Cooper's and Red-shouldered Hawks. The highlight of the day was definitely a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk that gave us a clear view of his "three points of light." However, we were also delighted by a few Broad-winged Hawks, a Merlin, and an Osprey. Great day Monday II!<br/>

Unfortunately, by 12:45 the fog reappeared with reinforcements, and we had to end our count early, despite our valiant efforts. However, the day still proved fruitful with 30 Turkey Vultures, 13 Red-tailed Hawks, 5 Red-shouldered Hawks, and one each of an Opsrey, a Northern Harrier, and a Cooper's Hawk. We also saw a flock of Black Swifts, as well as some very adorable Blue-gray Gnatcatchers. Hopefully we'll have more time with the birds next cycle!  <br/>

<p>A busy full day on Hawkwatch! Several Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures flooded the skies, as well as some early morning accipiters and an afternoon Northern Harrier. There was also a Mountain Lion reported on Slacker Hill in the morning, but Hawkwatchers did not spot the cat from Hawk Hill!<br/>

We also got very close up views of a bobcat on the beach and a very healthy seven point buck courting a doe black-tailed deer! Overall an exciting day out despite the gloomy weather.<br/>

During a morning walk along Coyote Trail, hawk watchers spied a Great Horned Owl and a White-tailed Kite. Up on Hawk Hill, our lovely volunteers recorded an Osprey, a number of American Kestrels, and a couple of Red-shouldered Hawks.

<p>Welcome to the Land of Fog! Unfortunately we were unable to get up to Hawk Hill today. We spent some time attempting to bird around Rodeo Lagoon, but the birds all seemed to be hiding away from the cold fog -- minus our resident female American Kestrel, who perches atop a telephone pole near the lagoon and always provides us with a little solace on these fogged out days. We ate lunch at the Annex with hopes of skies clearing in the afternoon. Despite the never-ending wall of white, we spotted an adult Red-tailed Hawk fly through the valley below the Annex only to disappear moments later. <br/>

However, we took full advantage of the weather by spending some quality time on a slide quiz and birding up at the annex where a Red-tailed Hawk, a couple Turkey Vultures, and a few curious Common Ravens flew by to lift our spirits.

<p>Regrettably, yesterday's beautiful weather decided not to stick around, and suffocating tendrils of fog gripped the hill all morning, forcing us to abandon the count for the day. The hawkwatch team spent the morning wandering the lagoon, and enjoyed good looks at Common Mergansers, Western Bluebirds, Chestnut-backed Chickadees, and a female Kestrel on a wire. We also got some good looks at our Kirby Cove Red-tailed Hawk pair. I'm beginning to think we should change Hawk Hill's name into "Fog Hill," and the GGRO into the "Golden Gate Fog Observatory." Better luck next time!<br/>

<p>Although our hopes for a beautiful clear hill were high today, the fog proved uncooperative once again. However, the team enjoyed watching the juvenile and adult red-tails from the annex, and a Cooper's Hawk flying into view over south slacker a few times. Our most exciting raptor encounter came around 1:00, when one of the adult Peregrines, calling like crazy, stooped upon a Cooper's Hawk who quickly dropped into the safety of the trees. It's really too bad the fog insisted on hanging around the hill today!<br/>

<p>Though the day started out foggy and gloomy, the fog lifted enough for us to take data at the hill today (finally)! We had a pretty good raptor show today, with Turkey Vultures and Red-tails being our main stars. The highlights included a Peregrine/Redtail aerial battle, a good overhead look at a few juvenile Cooper's Hawks, an exciting potential Merlin sighting, and a late Osprey. Spotted Towhees and Band-tailed Pigeons provided additional entertainment. I'm crossing my fingers that today marks the end of the fog onslaught, and that all the teams get up to the hill this week!  <br/>

<p>The fog has graced us with its presence once again today. The coastal flora must be happy. We were unable to record any data today, but volunteers enjoyed birding around Rodeo Lagoon and up Miwok trail. Despite the fog keeping us from Hawk Hill, it was a beautiful morning and we saw a handful of Red-tailed Hawks stilling just below the blanket of fog and taking advantage of wind currents to soar around the hills. We also saw a female American Kestrel, a group of Red-necked Phalaropes, and some bright Western Bluebirds. A great day nonetheless, but we're ready for a day of sunshine! <br/>

Other highlights were a Red-necked Phalarope, Common Mergansers, Willets, and a far off Osprey! We also saw a few hungry juvenile Red-tailed Hawks when we were waiting for the fog to lift at the annex. Hopefully the skies will clear up tomorrow.  <br/>

Peregrine Falcons zoomed around the Golden Gate Bridge, fiercely patrolling the skies. <br/>

<p>Determined and defiant, the Sunday II team was not about to let a little wind and rain stop us from spending at least some of the 2010 season's final day up on Hawk Hill. And so we scaled the hill one last time, arriving to sheets of rain billowing down from above. After counting a few raptors here and there, we decided we had endured for as long as we could and descended to 1064 for a potluck feast. Fittingly enough, the season's last bird turned out to be an adult Redtail spotted stilling over South Slacker around 11 a.m. just before the rain washed us off the hill. <br/><br/>A big thank you goes out to all our hawkwatchers who made this sometimes trying but altogether memorable 2010 season a success. Hope to see you all up top next fall.<br/>

<p>Saturday II rounded out its season with a tasty potluck featuring homemade grape leaves, quesadillas, veggie platters, many baked goods, and a variety of fine beverages (alas, no mulled wine). After a morning rain shower, a drizzle threatened the douse the day when the team arrived at Hawk Hill at 10:30. However, conditions improved to an ambient gray with faint winds and interesting cloud formations. There is not much in this entry about hawks because there were not many to be seen. After two hours of counting, the total stood at a whopping three. Though this improved to 60 by the end of the day, not much was moving in the Headlands today. The first Turkey Vulture didn't show up until 1:00, though the banders reported sighting a Ferruginous Hawk in the direction of the FM tower. Despite the low raptor numbers, what was to be had was a good time and good company as the season came to a close. Thanks to everyone for making hawkwatch a blast!<br/>

<p>Thursday II's final hawkwatch of 2010 took place under gray skies and ended half an hour early, thanks to the weatherman's promised rain showers. In between, however, the team treated itself to a fine potluck meal, fine drink, and a whopping 67 raptor sightings. A distinct lack of wind and the dropping barometer seemed to keep the raptors, including even those in Kirby Cove, perched and out of the skies. Although the hawks were almost uniformly high and distant, some lucky watchers got to take in an adult Cooper's Hawk before it disappeared behind Middle Kingdom, and a Northern Harrier was spotted in the North Saddle hanging out with two Turkey Vultures. Outside of raptors, the team diligently tallied tweets, including a charming Hermit Thrush, and nine different types of ocean-going vessels. It might have been a slow day, but spirits were high, and the season ended with good cheer.<br/>

<p>The Wednesday II team ended its season on a high note today, rounding out the year with great food, great drink and great looks at one fabulous juvenile Ferruginous Hawk during our last-day potluck. After soup and salad, the ferrug decided to interrupt desert by rising up in front of Hill 88 and proceeding to meander around the Headlands for 15 long, luscious minutes, offering everyone up on Hawk Hill the opportunity to affix their gaze upon its gleaming white breast and pointed wings for as long as they liked. Truly a wonderful bird to end our season on. In addition to the Ferruginous Hawk, the day also featured the close inspection of a lovely White-tailed Kite and several head-turning looks at some swift Peregrine Falcons.<br/>

<p>Tuesday II's season ended with a potluck smorgasbord, a chilly wind, and 105 hawks. While the team feasted on chili, crab dip, coleslaw, cornbread, crackers, chips, and tasty hot drinks and deserts that did not begin with the letter "C" some raptors did pass through the headlands. At least three juvenile Red-tailed Hawks were seen flapping across the Golden Gate, and several juvenile Northern Harriers coursed the hills in search of prey. However, the only the Accipiter spotted by hawkwatch today had to be presented in the form of an ID study by Hawk Blind. Perhaps the haze that lingered all day will lift later in the week and more late hawks will pass through. As the end of another season for Tuesday II drew to a close, the resident ravens were circling, hoping to find some crumbs left behind from another good day on Hawk Hill.<br/>

<p>The Monday II Hawkwatch team observed some fantastic birds today on Hawk Hill!  Early on, a hawkwatcher in South quadrant spotted an enormous brown raptor over Conzelman Road. The bird was missing random flight feathers and had a scruffy appearance overall. Almost immediately after the bird appeared, an adult Red-tailed Hawk, who was perched nearby, sounded its battle cry and flew up to stoop on the mystery bird.  However, in terms of size, the Red-tailed Hawk was miniscule by comparison!  As the dark raptor flew right by Hawk Hill, the hawkwatchers looked up and saw white axillary feathers on the bird's underwing, which allowed us to identify the bird as a juvenile Bald Eagle!  But the fun didn't end there.  The hawkwatchers also were treated to great looks at a low flying Peregrine, a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk, and a light-morph Swainson's Hawk.  Finally, in the late afternoon, a magnificent bird with an exceedingly long neck was spotted over the ocean.  The bird turned out to be a Sandhill Crane, a species that is rarely seen in the Bay Area (these birds can be viewed in large numbers around the Central Valley and Delta during the winter)!  Overall, a fantastic day to be up on Hawk Hill!<br/>

<p>The Sunday I Hawkwatchers finished the season in style, with a respectable total of two hundred and eight hawks counted.  This included your garden variety raptors as well as twelve Northern Harriers, a White-tailed Kite, seven Peregrine Falcons, and an intermediate-morph Swainson's Hawk.  The Swainson's Hawk was first spotted over Wolfback Ridge, and stuck around long enough for many of the Hawkwatchers to observe it in a spotting scope.  Of the adult Peregrine Falcons counted, several swept right over the top of Hawk Hill, allowing those Hawkwatchers with cameras to snap some excellent ventral shots of the birds.  One of the Peregrines flew so low over the hill that we could make out its enormous bulging crop with our naked eye!  Talk about a serious snack!  The count ended with two juvenile Northern Harriers who were spotted having a comical play-fight above Rodeo Valley Trail.  Thanks for a fantastic season Sunday I!<br/>

<p>Friday I finished its season with a hazy but beautiful day on the hill. Quite a few Red-tailed Hawks flew close by overhead, and a juvenile White-tailed Kite flew by at close range early in the morning. Other birds spotted included several Northern Harriers, a few male American Kestrels, and a speedy Merlin which was being attacked by an adult Red-tail. It had no trouble evading the bigger bird. Then, at nearly 3:30 the banders reported seeing a Rough-legged Hawk on Middle Kingdom; however, it was perched on the opposite side of the hill from hawkwatch, and when it flew, the hawkwatchers could not spot it. A thorough and excited scour of the petri dish field found only one juvenile Northern Harrier and two dueling juvenile Red-tails. They alternately sulked in coyote bushes and tangled on the ground, one on its back, the other standing on top. Although it was fun to watch the wrestling match the team would have preferred to snag the pizza bird. Despite the lack of luck in that department, the hawkwatchers are going to enjoy an end-of-season meal at Dario's anyway.<br/>

<p>The Thursday I Thanksgiving Day hawkwatchers went out with a bang when a juvenile Golden Eagle was spotted in the last half hour. West had it first, then it made its way over to Middle Kingdom and Slacker, showing off its golden head and bright white tail. Everyone on the hill was able to enjoy great looks at this spectacular bird. Earlier in the day, the team had a field day with Northern Harriers, spotting nine all told including a female and several pumpkin-breasted juveniles. Few Accipiters were to be had, with one adult Sharp-shinned paying a morning visit followed by a few juveniles. However, the Red-tailed Hawks were in fine form. Two adults took turns stooping on a juvenile in Kirby Cove, and several soared over the hill. Other notable raptors included a there-and-gone Merlin and a White-tailed Kite. Fun non-raptors included a group of Glaucous-winged Gulls and a floatilla of Surf Scoters. The 175 hawks--and assorted tweets--that graced Hawk Hill today made it a fine end to Thursday I's season.<br/>

<p>A strong morning push of migrating raptors and great looks at a juvenile Bald Eagle brought smiles to the faces of a delighted Wednesday I team today. During the early going, a sizable number of juvenile Red-tailed Hawks were joined by a few juvenile Cooper's Hawks and a wonderful juvenile Ferruginous Hawk who showed off a bit for the onlookers below before making its way toward the city. Later on in the day, the juvenile Bald Eagle graced us with its presence circling up high well over our heads before gliding away. Additionally, there was some speculation that a pair of large raptors flying steadily over San Francisco were in fact Golden Eagles but the birds were first sighted at a great distance and identification could not be confirmed. They both went down as unidentified raptors.        <br/>

Red-tailed Hawks were fairly active throughout the day and a few American Kestrels, a lone Cooper's Hawk and a Peregrine Falcon were also seen. The day's highlight proved to be a distant White-tailed Kite repeatedly diving at a Redtail that must have been doing something exceedingly irritating.  <br/>

<p>Fearful of a third consecutive rain out, the Sunday II team was delighted to find mostly blue skies and a light breeze up on the hill for most of the day today. Red-tailed Hawks dominated the count but Peregrine Falcons stole the show. Peregrines were spotted circling up over Hawk Hill, shooting through the clouds over Alcatraz and, on several occasions, diving at Red-tailed Hawks who had the misfortune of wandering into their airspace.

<p>Saturday II spent a blustery day on Hawk Hill, counting in conditions best described as "cold." The day started with a drizzle and ended with looming storm clouds. The south winds did not bring many hawks, either. A total of 73 were tallied, and among those birds were only two Accipiters (two Sharp-shinned Hawks). However, four Peregrine Falcons came overhead, and a pair of Red-tailed Hawks--one adult and one juvenile--put on a show of dog fighting for several minutes with spectacular stoops and rolls. With a dark, menacing cloud approaching from the north, the watch was called an hour early.<br/>

<p>It was a warm day on Hawk Hill with light winds out of the north to northwest. The Tuesday II team also found it to be a slow day for hawks, counting a total of 155 raptors at a rate of about 26 hawks per hour. However, the team was rewarded with some good looks at Merlins. One obligingly perched on a snag in the pines and another shot up out of Kirby Cove and then circled--slowly for a falcon--in full view for a few minutes. Some White-tailed Kits and a handful of dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks (all juveniles) were also seen, to lend an air of variety to the count.<br/>

<p>It was a blustery day for the Monday II Hawkwatch team on Hawk hill.  With north winds reaching almost twenty miles an hour, it was a chore simply to keep our spotting scopes upright!  In contrast, the hawks migrating through the Headlands were definitely making use of the strong winds. The team saw great variety of raptors today, including several Ferruginous Hawks, a Swainson's Hawk, a handful of dark morph Red-tailed Hawks, and two White-tailed Kites. Although Rough-legged Hawks have yet to be seen from Hawk Hill this season, perhaps tomorrow's Hawkwatch team will count one!<br/>

<p>What do dark morph Red-tailed Hawks, White-tailed Kites, and Peregrine Falcons make?  A fantastic day for the Sunday I Hawkwatch team!  North winds, visibility all the way to San Jose, and mild temperatures also served as great weather conditions for migratory raptors.  The Hawkwatch team counted a fairly steady stream of raptors all day long.  Several raptors including a male Northern Harrier, a White-tailed Kite, and a beautiful dark brown Red-tailed Hawk right sailed right past the Hawkwatch (to our delight!).  At the end of the day, the team also was able to see GGRO's new telemetry bird, a juvenile female Red-tailed Hawk, released from Hawk Hill.  The GGRO telemetry team will track this bird in order to collect data on Red-tailed Hawk migration/dispersal patterns in California.<br/>

We had some great looks at juvenile Red-shouldered Hawks and adult Accipiters. After a long string of foggy Saturdays, we couldn't have asked for a more pleasant day to watch hawks.<br/>

<p>The skies were blue, the winds were light, the temperatures were mild, and there were not very many hawks for today's hawkwatch team to count. The hawks that were seen seemed to come in small clusters of activity interspersed with periods of watching a painted lady butterfly or two blimps circle the Bay. Several Sharp-shinned Hawks again paid the hill a close visit, rising out of Kirby Cove and circling at close quarters. Juvenile Northern Harriers also provided some entertaining looks out over the valley and a handful of Merlins shot the Golden Gate, southbound. Finally, a Cooper's Hawk thrashed energetically around a coyote bush on the slope of Rocky Ridge, frenetically trying to flush a small bird. It eventually succeeded but its prey and it escaped out of the hawkwatchers' sight.<br/>

<p>The Thursday I hawkwatch team made it to Hawk Hill bright and early and was greeted with a juvenile Northern Harrier and strong winds that gusted up to twenty miles per hour. Fortunately, the wind died down after an hour or so, leaving the team with a beautiful day. The count was good for the first several hours, and some Sharp-shinned Hawks were spotted at close quarters as they wrapped around the hill, pushed by the wind. But the day's highlight was watching a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk stoop on one of the blinds and be captured successfully. As the day went on, the raptor flow died down: hawks, it seems, do not change their clocks, so by 3:00 the skies were pretty empty. At the end of the day four species had reached double-digit numbers--Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, Sharp-shinned Hawks, and Cooper's Hawks--and nine species had been seen.<br/>

Red-shouldered Hawks were the spectacle early as a handful of birds, including a brightly red-breasted adult, were seen here and there during the morning. Red-tailed Hawks and Cooper's Hawks dominated the midday hours before a few furious falcons entered the fray and grabbed the attention of the group near day's end when a 2:00 Merlin blasted through the sky and a smattering of adult Peregrine Falcons circled up over the hill, delighting the pleased onlookers below.   <br/>

<p>The day started off great! Our first sighting was an Osprey, and then a juvenile Peregrine passed right by the hill. The skies were clear, the wind was just a light breeze and off in the distance to the northwest we saw a juvenile Bald Eagle! It came closer as it headed south, passing by us and heading over the Gate into San Francisco. We were able to tell from its plumage that it was likely in its first year. We saw the usual suspects for the rest of the day, most of them up high. We had several Merlins come by, always exciting. The clouds rolled in at around 2:30 and we started to feel some rain drops, so we high-tailed it off the hill.<br/>

<p>It was quality over quantity for the Monday I team today as a handful of interesting sightings helped to keep the team alert and engaged for most of the day. The morning was dominated by Peregrine Falcon activity with several adult and juvenile birds seen. At one point, the team was split between watching two adult Peregrines circling high in the clouds overhead and a juvenile Peregrine slashing through the sky over Slacker Hill. Later on after the Peregrine show came to an end, a trio of tantalizing birds created quite a lot of buzz up on the hill. The first was a juvenile Swainson's Hawk making a rare early November appearance in the Headlands. Next was an adult female Northern Harrier who rose up right in front of the hill offering up splendid looks. And last was a bird still being discussed by hawkwatchers hours after it was spotted, a possible light morph Harlan's Hawk that circled up and then made a beeline for Kirby Cove.        <br/>

<p>Although there is still road work being done, Conzelman and McCullough opened to the public on November 6. (For more see the ggro.org main page.) The Saturday II team made it to the hill, sans construction hats and vests for the first time in 2010 only to find that a thick bank of fog had rolled in. After sticking it out for about three hours, they headed back down and took a walk on the Bobcat Trail. There a Kestrel was harassing a Red-tailed Hawk and a coyote was hunting rodents. The fog did eventually clear, revealing a beautiful day, but only after the hawkwatchers' day had been called. However, everyone enjoyed the return to "normalcy" on Hawk Hill.<br/>

<p>Lately the flow of hawks has picked up, and today's hawkwatch team continued that trend with 329 sightings, 10 species, and 54.8 hawks per hour. The day started off with strong northeast winds which slowly backed off throughout the afternoon and eventually swung around to the north. Leading the species count were Red-tailed Hawks, followed closely by Turkey Vultures. Cooper's Hawks and Sharp-shinned Hawks were also on tap all day. The Sharpies in particular had to fight the morning's wind and many shot around the hill with wings tucked. Rarer hawks seen included Northern Harriers, one of which was a male, seven Peregrine Falcons, and one dark-morph Swainson's Hawk, which was escorted by two adult Red-tails and one disgruntled Peregrine. The team picked up its tenth species in the last fifteen minutes of watching--a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk that winged in from Mt. Tamalpais.<br/>

<p>The Sharp-shinned Hawks were on the move in a big way today. Buoyed by a bountiful early November Sharpie flight that included a good-sized number of blue-backed, rufous-barred adults, the Wednesday II team tallied the largest hawks per hour total in a little over two weeks during a pleasant near six hour day up on the hill. In addition, the team was also treated to a wonderfully close encounter with a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk who rose up from the valley and circled the hill before departing in the direction of San Francisco. And before that Ferruginous Hawk made its presence felt, the team got to glimpse an adult Peregrine Falcon making a spectacular dive on a juvenile Peregrine most unwelcome in its airspace. <br/>

<p>Today's hawkwatch saw high surf at the lagoon, clear skies overhead, and a fair flow of hawks. At the end of the afternoon, the team had tallied 249 hawks representing 7 species. The day's highlight by far were the 15 Merlins seen from the hill. Four seen in the morning were supplemented by 11 in the afternoon, by which time "Merlin, schmerlin" jokes were in order. Not only were they plentiful, several passed close by, affording good looks, and at least one was seen nabbing a dragonfly in midair and it eating on the wing. Also exciting was a group of 4 White-tailed Kites that winged up the valley, showing off their beautiful plumage. Other birds seen included early-morning large flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons, and--of more importance--good numbers of Accipiters and Red-tailed Hawks.<br/>

<p>The raptors are still on the move!  Another day of clear skies, mild easterly winds, and moderate temperatures served as perfect conditions for our taloned migrants to move through the Headlands.  Red-tailed Hawks still dominated the count, with juveniles outnumbering adults.  Blue-backed accipiters, White-tailed Kites, an adult male Northern Harrier, and numerous Merlin also were "oooohed and aaaahed" over by the Hawkwatch team today.  However, the creme de la creme for the day was a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk.  It was spotted riding a thermal above Hawk Hill.  I think it's safe to say that no GGRO hawkwatcher gets tired of seeing those milky giants!<br/>

<p>Sunny skies this morning were a welcome change from the wet weather the Headlands experienced over the last few days.  Apparently, the hawks thought so too, because they were out and about in full force.  Today's Hawkwatch team counted ten species of raptors for a total count of nearly three hundred birds.  White-throated Swifts and Violet-green Swallows also filled the skies in the early morning, catching bugs and performing loop-de-loops in the air.  Adult and juvenile Red-tailed comprised the majority of raptorial birds counted.  Several groups of these adult Red-tails were spotted talon grappling during the day.  Peregrines, Merlins, and White-tailed Kites were also observed powering on through the Headlands.  If the nice weather keeps up, tomorrow's Hawkwatch team should get to observe some great birds as well.<br/>

<p>Clear skies in the morning gave us hope and we did indeed see some accipiters in the mist! A pair of ravens kept us company while we gazed into the haze in hopes of seeing some raptors. We had to suspend our count for an hour while we waited for some squalls to pass, but the continued fog and eventual downpour chased us off the hill.<br/>

<p>It was another cloudy, overcast day at hawkwatch, and one where the hawks were few and far between but some good sightings were to be had. A small team of four braved the predictions for rain and inclement weather--which never fully materialized--to see a juvenile rufous-morph Red-tailed Hawk, two adult Peregrine Falcons, and a Merlin. All four birds flew near or directly over the hill, providing nice looks. Other birds seen included a smattering of Accipiters, both juveniles and adults. They tended to pop up from Kirby Cove and power quickly across the Golden Gate, looking for sunny skies to the south. As the afternoon progressed, fewer hawks were sighted, but two Common Ravens appeared and croaked sweetly to each other, providing entertainment for the hawkwatchers.<br/>

<p>It has been said that on days before frontal systems arrive, hawk counts are either really good or really poor, and today it was the later. Thursday I's hawkwatch team anticipated the possibility of a rainy day, but found only gray skies and peculiar cloud formations on the hill. The team also found hawks, but had only 110 total sightings. Leading the coolness pack, however, were two dark-morph birds: an adult Red-tailed Hawk and a juvenile Swainson's Hawk. Both provided good looks. Sharp-shinned Hawks beat out Cooper's Hawks by far, at 30 to 4, and in an unusual move, the team sighted more Red-tailed Hawks than Turkey Vultures. The weather cooperated all day long, with not a single drop of rain falling, all four bridges in view to the south, and the wind only picking up in the last hour or so. <br/>

<p>The Wednesday I team enjoyed a breezy, laid-back day up on the hill today with a sprinkling of intriguing sightings--including a late Swainson's Hawk, the fourth seen this season--keeping the team engaged throughout. The Swainson's Hawk, first sighted low against the rolling hills of the Headlands, eventually rose up and sailed right over a delighted group of hawkwatchers offering up spectacular looks. The day was also a good one for Northern Harriers, adult Sharp-shinned Hawks and especially Merlins, several of whom sped by the hill for up close and personal encounters. Songbird-wise, Varied Thrushes continue to be seen in greater numbers and a few more Evening Grosbeaks also graced us with their presence.       <br/>

<p>Another great count day on Hawk Hill!  Although the Hawkwatch team was not inundated with thousands of birds in the sky, we did count eleven raptor species today!  Clear skies and westerly winds for most of the day served as the perfect conditions for a raptor flight.  Everyone was particularly delighted to see a beautiful juvenile Golden Eagle rise up in front of Mt. Tamalpais.  The Hawkwatch team also spotted several Merlin powering through the Headlands today.  One of them was catching dragonflies on the wing and eating them like popcorn!  For all those birders out there, a handful of Pine Siskins, a Red Crossbill, and two dozen Greater White-Fronted Geese were also observed from Hawk Hill. <br/>

<p>It took a little while but eventually the raptors arrived for the Monday I team today. A slow morning turned into a wild afternoon as the team attempted to juggle several groups of birds during an end of day flurry. Multiple Merlins darted through the sky. A host of Red-tailed Hawks, several dark morphs included, came in out of the clouds. Two Northern Harriers bobbed and weaved near Slacker Hill. A far-off Peregrine Falcon buzzed the FM tower. And a lone juvenile Golden Eagle popped up from behind the pines--all in the last two hours of the watch. Happy after such a great rush of birds, the team descended the hill at 3:30 p.m. <br/>

<p>In the immortal words of Allen Fish, "It's never a good idea to second guess the weather." As Saturday II discovered today, the weather does not stand for second-guessing. So while the team was expecting rain, they found a clear hill beneath gray skies. However, hawkwatch was still not possible today because, in slightly less famous words, it's also never a good idea to second guess  construction sites. Somehow, both points of access to Hawk Hill were blocked or locked off from the hawkwatchers. Stymied but not defeated, the group did some headlands birding, found an adult Red-tailed Hawk and a floatilla of Western Grebes, and adjourned to Mill Valley where additional birds were to be found, including a large flock of Willets and a bridge Peregrine--just not <i>that</i> bridge Peregrine. It is hoped that following the forecast rains this weekend, the skies will fill with raptors to entertain next week's hawkwatchers.<br/>

<p>Thursday II dodged the bullet with encroaching fog and lowering gray clouds and completed a successful hawkwatch. Despite some threatening weather moments, including some fog in the valley, visibility remained good for the balance of the day, and conditions were moderate on the hill. The raptor flow was slow, with only 218 counted in nearly six hours, but adult Accipiters have been coming through, and they continued today. Good looks were to be had at several that flew right overhead. Other highlights included eight male American Kestrels, one of which perched at the top of a tree and showed off, and a pumpkin-orange juvenile Northern Harrier. <br/>

<p>Wednesday II's Hawkwatch team seems to have all the luck!  Today they were the first weekday team to make it back up on Hawk Hill. (NOTE: The road is still closed to the general public, so there is no access to Hawk Hill.)<br/><br/>Although there was heavy fog at the level of the hill in the early morning, the fog lifted around 11 a.m., so the team was still able to count for more than four hours.  We saw some fantastic birds today, including a juvenile Peregrine Falcon that attacked a Cooper's Hawk and then flew right over the Hawkwatch team, and a juvenile Broad-winged Hawk that popped up around the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Several White-tailed Kites and adult accipiters also materialized out of the fog.  Evening Grosbeaks and Red Crossbills were also spotted on the hill today.  Overall, today turned out to be a fantastic day to see hawks in the headlands.<br/>

<p>The hawkwatch team divided its day between birdwatching around the lagoon while waiting out some thick fog and hawkwatching at the alternate site. Although the team was pushed off the hill by fog shortly before 3:00, the day's tally came to a respectable 214 birds at 71.3 hawks per hour, with eight species seen. A couple of Broad-winged Hawks paid the hill a visit, as did a White-tailed Kite and many adult Accipiters. Toward the end of the day's count, the fog in the bay caused the migrants to stack up and form confused kettles among the ever-present Turkey Vultures.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, at the lagoon, ninety minutes of birdwatching yielded 41 species, including such highlights as an Elegant Tern, excellent looks at songbirds including a pair of Common Yellowthroats, a dive-bombing Brown Pelican, a juvenile Black-crowned Night Heron, and three species of raptor.<br/>

<p>The Sunday I Hawkwatch team was confident that we could suffer through a little precipitation today if hawks were moving about.  However, the intermittent periods of dense fog, persistent heavy rain, and the overall lack of hawks in the sky, gradually wore away our resolve.  A few Song Sparrows, Band-tailed Pigeons, and one Red-shafted Flicker kept us entertained for the brief period of time we were on Hawk Hill. Heavy rain forced us to retire from Hawk Hill around 10:30am.  Back at Fort Cronkhite, The Hawkwatch team decided that a field trip was in order, so we all headed up to the Marine Mammal Center.  It was fascinating to see the Elephant seals Mirounga angustirostris) and California Sea Lions (Zalophus californianus) in the rehabilitation pens and learn about the typical species that annually cycle through the center.  <br/>

Before visibility completely closed up, the team was treated to fogtastic views of the bay and several kettles of Turkey Vultures, who were showing off their flying abilities above the clouds.

Since it was Thursday I's first day of counting, the team was relieved to be free of the fog--though it meant dealing with inhospitable temperatures it was finally possible to count hawks. The team was rewarded with good looks at multiple Red-tailed Hawks and Cooper's Hawks that soared close overhead, as well as sightings of two Osprey and a handful of American Kestrels and Northern Harriers. The day's highlight, though, was a pair of falcons: a magnificent adult Peregrine Falcon on its way south, and an unusually late Prairie Falcon that came roaring through the headlands on a beeline for San Francisco.<br/>

A midday spurt of raptors, mainly Red-tailed Hawks, Cooper's Hawks and Sharp-shinned Hawks, was bracketed by periods of idleness in the early and late going. Broad-winged Hawks continued to stream by and there was a noticeable uptick in the number of adult accipiters beginning to join the many juveniles on their southward migration. On the songbird front, the first Varied Thrush seen this season was spotted early in the morning just as the team ascended the hill.  <br/>

<p>There was fog below and mostly blue skies above for the Sunday II team today. Raptor-wise, not much was on the move in the morning but by early afternoon, when the fog eventually dissipated, a steady flow of birds began to stream by. Included among the assortment of Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks and Coopers Hawks that made up the majority of the count were two Ferruginous Hawks sighted in the sky to the left of Battery Spencer, a handful of close-in Broad-winged Hawks and a lone juvenile Golden Eagle seen silhouetted against Mount Tamalpais. The team rounded out the day by watching the aerial acrobatics of the Blue Angels before descending the hill.<br/>

<p>The skies were clear for Saturday hawkwatch and the annual Blue Angels festivities. Although the weather was cooperative with bright sun and light winds, the flow of hawks was light. The number of blue steel birds seemed to outnumber the hawks in the last hour, when the team had to scour the hills to add a falcon--an American Kestrel--to the count. Earlier in the day the team did get to observe an adult male Northern Harrier and aerial courtship displays from the local pair of Red-tailed Hawks that live in Kirby Cove. Also in the skies, the hawkwatchers' perspective made it seem that the fighter jets were stooping on passing Accipiters, but all of the real birds merely continued their flights south, no doubt puzzled by all the racket overhead.<br/>

<p>The day started off calm with some high cirrus clouds that thinned as the day got warmer and the wind picked up. We saw a pair of White-tailed Kites at the start of our day and had a juvenile Golden Eagle soar over the hill. Later in the day we had an up-close view of a Swainson's Hawk, some Broad-winged Hawks, and a couple of Peregrine Falcons. Several Merlins led in for the Blue Angels who were practicing again for the air shows this weekend. There were not a lot of birds today, but we had some great views and a nice variety of species.<br/>

<p>Today started off with some high clouds shading us, but we still had nice views of birds during our busiest hour from 10 to 11. Flickers and Meadow larks were also flying about, and we got a long look at a Yellow-shafted flicker that perched on a rock. Highlights today included a distant dark-morph juvenile Broad-winged hawk as well as a juvenile Ferruginous hawk and an adult Cooper's hawk. The clouds cleared in the afternoon in time for the Blue Angels and others to practice their maneuvers for the Fleet Week air show this weekend.<br/>

<p>When our data recorder announced that we had already counted over one hundred raptors by 11:00 a.m. today, I began to think that the Wednesday II Hawkwatch team was in for some serious raptor-related thrills.  This proved to be the case when five White-tailed Kites surprised everyone by flying directly over the observation site!  The team also spotted three immature Golden Eagles today, one of which was close enough to see without the aid of binoculars.  Finally, when a juvenile Broad-winged Hawk appeared above the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge and then flew right by the Hawkwatchers, this was really the icing on the cake.  The kettles of fifteen or more Turkey Vultures that formed near Hawk Hill were also nothing short of spectacular! Our count of six hundred and sixty-nine raptors currently stands as the highest hawk count this season! Clear skies, westerly winds, and warm weather thermals created the perfect conditions for raptor watching.   <br/>

<p>There were Golden Eagles galore today for the Tuesday II team. The afternoon featured visits from three young eagles, all of whom offered long, captivating looks that didnt require squinting or undue neck craning. The Golden Eagle pace has picked up considerably with five now sighted in the last two days. Today also set the season-high for both Merlins and Northern Harriers as eight Merlins and 12 Northern Harriers made an appearance on the count sheet. Songbird-wise, a handful of Northern Flickers  most of which were Red-shafted but some of which were clearly intergrades between Yellow-shafted and Red-shafted  busied themselves in the scrub near our alternate hawkwatching site early in the day. <br/>

<p>Today's Hawkwatch team observed a relative smorgasbord of raptors!  Although the total number of raptors counted was not the all-time high for this season, we did count fourteen hawk species!  This included everything from White-tailed Kites and Golden Eagles (the first of the season) to Broad-winged Hawks and Ferruginous Hawks.  We also witnessed some hilarious aerial scuffles.  At one point, a juvenile Cooper's hawk ran into an adult Peregrine in the air, and the Peregrine did a few "log rolls."  Then the Peregrine proceeded to scream its head off.  A juvenile Ferruginous hawk that was minding its own business happened upon this scene, and was promptly harassed and bumped by the Peregrine.  This peregrine was then joined by another, and they circled the area, screaming back and forth at each other.  I guess the moral of this story is "don't mess with big falcons!"<br/>

<p>This morning, the Sunday Hawkwatch team was met with heavy fog hanging around the level of Hawk Hill.  Although the outlook for the day appeared bleak, the team decided to observe raptors from the level of the Annex, with the hope that the fog would eventually clear. At the Annex, we were happy to observe several accipiters and White-tailed Kites hunting the South Slacker ridge. When the fog began to lift around 10:30 a.m., we decided to head up the hill and start counting raptors.  Considering our later start time, we still counted a significant number of raptors today.  The majority of raptors we saw included Turkey Vultures, adult Red-tailed Hawks, juvenile Cooper's Hawks, and juvenile Sharp-shinned Hawks.  We also saw a fair number of American Kestrels and one Merlin.<br/>

<p>Once again, Saturday I's team was doomed to fog. We took a trip to the rifle range where we saw an adult Red-tailed hawk. Then we drove to the overlook at Bird Rock and saw another Red-tail perched near Battery Alexander. Some Turkey Vultures and a Kestrel were also seen in the Headlands today but, unfortunately, the top of Hawk Hill was not. Maybe next time it will be clear?<br/>

<p>The Friday I team made its first appearance at the alternate hawkwatch site after being shut out by fog or spending the day at the spring migration site for the first three weeks of the 2010 season. The morning was overcast but visibility was good, and by the afternoon the wind had picked up and the skies had cleared. A total of 260 hawks winged past the hawkwatchers, for an average of 52 hawks per hour. Sharp-shinned Hawks were the best-represented species, with 67 total individuals counted, including one adult that showed off its blue back. Cooper's Hawks were sparser, coming in at 29. Merlins and Kestrels put in appearances, along with Peregrine Falcons, one of which put on a spectacular show by stooping on an unfortunate Sharp-shinned Hawk. Other sightings included an early afternoon Osprey directly overhead and two Northern Harriers, one an adult mail.<br/>

<p>The skies remained indifferent to the Thursday I team's optimism and enthusiasm, and foggy conditions prevailed today at the alternate hawkwatch site. When the group met in the morning, they birded briefly around the visitor center in hopes of seeing a Black-and-white Warbler then headed up to attempt a hawkwatch. However, strong winds dense fog, and no visibility greeted them, so they retreated to a sheltered spot and waited for the rest of the morning. In the afternoon, the fog opened up around Kirby Cove, so the group got in some birding at the Annex, where the local Red-tails and some Accipiters were to be seen.<br/>

A variety of species, 13 in all, were spotted during six hours of counting. Great scope looks at three juvenile Broad-winged Hawks and an adult Swainson's Hawk making its way across the Bay toward San Francisco proved to be the highlights. <br/><br/>Falcons abounded as well with five Merlins, five American Kestrels and three Peregrine Falcons all announcing their presence. The Merlin abundance was a special treat, especially since several came shooting right by the hill allowing for spectacular looks as the birds headed south. <br/><br/>There were even some interesting migrant songbirds out and about: Townsend's and Yellow Warblers, Horned Larks, Pine Siskins, Violet-green and Northern Rough-winged Swallows and hundreds of Vaux's Swifts to name a few. All in all, a great day for watching feathered fliers in the Headlands. <br/>

<p>The hawkwatch team sweated it out on the hill today under a clear sky. Temperatures reached into the mid-nineties, and winds were light from the north. The team was greeted by three Northern Harriers and some morning Kestrels. Many good looks of Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks were to be had as they rode the thermals south, and six Merlins transited through as well.  However, the highlights of the day were excellent, long looks at some spectacular birds. A juvenile Broad-winged Hawk showed off in the Golden Gate for over five minutes (others of its compatriots soared high above in kettles of vultures and Accipiters), and a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk shot out of the north and circled in front of the hill, affording a great view for all. The grand rara avis finale came when an adult dark-morph Ferruginous Hawk came gliding in from beneath the FM tower and proceeded to circle up, slowly gaining altitude and finally melting away into the East Bay.<br/>

<p>The air was hot with a warm breeze for today's HawkWatch. While we didn't count as many birds today as in previous days, likely due to the weak winds, we saw an amazing diversity of species. We had some great up-close views of Merlins and an adult Broad-winged hawk in addition to the many Accipiters migrating by. At one point in the day we had a kettle of two juvenile Ferruginous hawks, a juvenile Northern Harrier, and two Turkey Vultures directly above where we were standing.

<p>Thursday II enjoyed a temperate and not terribly windy day at the alternate hawkwatch site. A generally northwest wind helped push a nice, if somewhat intermittent, flight through the headlands, and the hawkwatchers saw a total of 429 raptors. Among those birds were several stand-out species including Ferruginous Hawk, Swainson's Hawk, Merlin, and White-tailed Kite. The hill was also visited by numerous juvenile Cooper's and Sharp-shined Hawks, many of which afforded watchers great looks before they set out to points south. A handful of Peregrine Falcons and Red-shouldered Hawks helped to round out an eleven-species day.<br/>

<p>"Next time we should bring a kite." The hawkwatchers spent a windy and fairly busy day at the alternative hawkwatch site, with clusters of Accipiters coursing through the headlands accompanied by a fair number of kestrels and a Merlin. Other species seen included an Osprey, a few Peregrine Falcons, and Red-shouldered Hawks. The sky was blue and the sun was out, so many good looks were available, although as the wind strengthened holding binoculars steady on distant birds. Highlights included views of Sharp-shinned Hawks and Cooper's Hawks dog-fighting before heading south across the Golden Gate.<br/>

<p>After several days of heavy fog and drizzle, the Hawkwatch team was rewarded with clear skies and a fantastic count of four hundred and ninety raptors today!  The accipiters are officially moving en masse! When the team first arrived at our alternate hawk counting site, the fog was sitting low over the ocean.  However, around 10 a.m., the fog rose and reduced visibility on the hill to less than 0.1 mi.  Although we were discouraged, the fog cleared again by 11 a.m., to everyone's relief.  That's when the excitement began.  Sharp-shinned Hawks started filling the skies around 11 a.m. and increased in number until 3 p.m. Cooper's Hawks really started popping up between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.  Today's Hawkwatch team was also happily surprised by the appearance of two juvenile Broad-winged Hawks over the bay!  One of these birds flew right by the count site.  These are the first Broad-winged Hawks to be counted by Hawkwatch this season.  We also observed one White-tailed Kite hovering by the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Juvenile Red-tailed Hawks and juvenile Sharp-shinned Hawks comprised the majority of the total count today.   <br/>

<p>During the first fifteen minutes of observation time on Hawk hill today, the Hawkwatch team counted four accipiters and three American Kestrels. This left the team feeling pretty optimistic about the rest of the day.  However, when the fog rolled in around 10 a.m., visibility on Hawk hill was substantially reduced.  A short time after that, it began to drizzle.  No birds were counted from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. This being the case, the Hawkwatch team decided to throw in the towel for the day.  <br/>

<p>Today was foggy with a hint of a drizzle, but we bravely set off on a walk around Rodeo Lagoon. There were no raptors to be found, but we did see a Wandering Tattler. We took a field trip to the Las Gallinas ponds and saw a dark morph Red-tailed Hawk perched on a power pole, several Northern Harriers, and a couple American Kestrels. There are raptors out there, but they are difficult to spot in the thick Headlands fog. Maybe next time, Saturday I.<br/>

<p>Friday I was greeted with damp, dense, (relatively) warm fog at Fort Cronkhite, so with no signs of clearing, the team took a walk up Bobcat Trail to see what else could be seen. The visibility remained the same throughout the morning, with the only change in conditions being a shift from mere fog to some light pinprick drizzle.<br/><br/>However, there was quite a bit of wildlife to enjoy, including 23 species of birds, four of which were raptors. The nature hike yielded various mammals, reptiles, insects and mollusks, plus 23 bird species, including four raptors. The birds were: Turkey Vulture, Red-tailed Hawk (juvenile), Coopers Hawk (juvenile), Northern Harrier, Wrentit, White-crowned Sparrow, Lincolns Sparrow, Song Sparrow, House Wren, Black Phoebe, Says Phoebe, Pacific Slope Flycatcher, Bushtit, Chestnut-backed Chickadee, American Goldfinch, Lesser Goldfinch, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, Spotted Towhee, Common Raven, Annas Hummingbird, Mourning Dove, Yellow Warbler, Common Yellowthroat.<br/>

<p>Heavy morning fog in the Headlands crushed any hope of the Wednesday 1 team ascending the hill to our alternate hawkwatching site today. Instead, the team circled Rodeo Lagoon and spotted several Common Yellowthroats, Yellow Warblers and Great and Snowy Egrets among other species. Toward the end of the walk, a Merlin flew in and perched high in a conifer no more than 50 feet from us. The bird stayed there for 10 minutes allowing nice long scope looks before being displaced by a Red-tailed Hawk. The watch was called at 1 p.m.  <br/>

A juvenile Northern Harrier provided nice looks before circling upward into the hazy layer of fog. And a male American Kestrel hover-hunted here and there for a time near the watch site.

<p>After drawing a very foggy and windy first day, the Thursday II team was treated to a bright sunny day that began with light winds from the southeast and concluded with stronger winds from the northwest and fog rolling in beneath the alternate hawkwatch site. Good looks were to be had at male and female Kestrels, many juvenile Red-tails including some dark morphs, and an adult Cooper's Hawk. Meanwhile, the Peregrine Falcon stood sentry on the north tower. The highlight of the day came when a Bald Eagle chose to pay the Headlands a visit. At the end of the day, the team had tallied a total of 214 hawks representing 8 species at a rate of 38.9 per hour.<br/>

<p>Although the Hawkwatch team was optimistic about observing raptors today, alas, the fog won out, and we had to call the count off.  However, we decided to stroll around the lagoon at Fort Cronkhite, and saw a Western Sandpiper, a Least Sandpiper, a Green Heron, and several Yellow Warblers. After a brief stop at the Headlands Visitor's Center (to fuel up on hot chocolate), we made our way up to the annex on Conzelman road (to see if the fog had receded there at all).  Visibility was still poor there, but we did happen to see three adult Red-tailed Hawks talon-grappling over Rodeo Lagoon.  Hopefully tomorrow's Hawkwatch team will have better luck!<br/>

The day started off hazy and warm with very minimal wind. Early on, the Hawkwatch team got to witness a kestrel and an accipiter having a "disagreement."  The leucistic Bewick's Wren also made another appearance at the count site.  The temperature peaked around noon with a high of eighty-seven degrees Fahrenheit.  Later in the afternoon, winds from the WSW picked up speed and helped cool off the Hawkwatch team.  Juvenile Red-tailed Hawk were seen more than any other type of raptor today.<br/>

For all of you Osprey and American Kestrel fans out there, today was the day to see those birds up close.  The Hawkwatch team was privileged to see nine Osprey and twelve American Kestrels during our count!  One of the American Kestrels flew by with several hummingbirds in hot pursuit!  Juvenile Cooper's Hawks and one Sharp-shinned Hawks also flew in fairly close to the Hawkwatch team, which allowed new Hawkwatchers to practice their accipiter identification skills.  So far, this was one highest hawk counts for the GGRO 2010 season.<br/>

The Hawkwatch team was also treated to some great close-up views of juvenile Red-shouldered hawks adult and Peregrine Falcons.

However, seeing two Osprey, which appeared to be heading south, zoom over our heads, made up for the extremely windy weather!  We also observed several American Kestrels, a few Northern Harriers, and one Cooper's hawk with a gigantic bulging crop (looked like it just had a big snack!). The majority of raptors we saw today were juvenile Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures. Good luck to tomorrow's Hawkwatch team!<br/>

<p>The heat continued today, with temperatures reaching 99 degrees in light winds that tailed off as the afternoon progressed. Sightings were up a little too. Two hundred and forty-two total hawks were observed, and Turkey Vultures and juvenile Red-tailed Hawks again were the most common raptors. Adding to the mix when hawk sightings are slow in coming, an apparently leucistic Bewick's Wren has been hanging around the alternate hawkwatch site for the past day or so.<br/>

<p>The Headlands really heated up today, with the ambient temperature ranging above eighty degrees Fahrenheit and minimal wind until after 2:00 p.m.  However, the Hawkwatchers sweat it out at our alternate hawk watch site today, and were rewarded with several sightings of American Kestrels and juvenile Red-shouldered Hawks.  Overall juvenile Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures were the most common raptors seen today.<br/>

<p>Although today started off with heavy fog over Hawk Hill, the Hawkwatch team was optimistic that the fog would soon clear. So, we hiked up to Hawk Hill and started counting raptors at 10:45 a.m.  It turned out to be a great day to hawk watch!  The fog gave way to the warm sun by noon, and after that, we could see all the way to Mount Tamalpais.  Gentle winds from the NNW direction predominated during the day.  The most common species seen today were Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures.  The Red-tailed hawks were mainly playful, awkward juveniles, who hung around the Headlands for several hours. We also saw several female American Kestrels and juvenile Red-shouldered hawks.  The total number of hawks counted today was 152 hawks.  Since we counted hawks for 4.75 hours, our rate of hawks per hour was 32.  Hopefully tomorrowâs Hawkwatch will also enjoy great weather and have plenty of raptors to watch!<br/>

<p>Daily HawkBlog: First Day on Hawk Hill!<br/><br/>We got off to a late start as we waited out the weather and sorted out all the business for the Saturday I crew's first day of the season. We spent some time at the Annex waiting for the skies to clear slightly and finally made it up to Hawk Hill around noon. Visibility was fair with the fog continuing to lift, although the sun really didn't break through until about 2:30. Today was mostly a practice run and we only spent three hours on the hill, but we did see a lot of Turkey vultures and some Red-tailed hawks playing around in the sky. The only other raptor species we saw was an osprey, although we did spot a dark morph juvenile Red-tail! Our total count was 84 raptors in 3.25 hours with a rate of 25.8 hawks per hour.<br/><br/>

<p>Much like Thursday I, the Friday I team spent a day in the fog. Although there were no birds to be seen--with the exception of Fog Phoenixes--the group was able to get oriented to the site and go over protocols. With the fog remaining heavy, the team adjourned to the annex shortly before one to eat lunch and watch the local Red-tails.<br/>

<p>It was a low thick fog in the Headlands today.  The optimistic Hawkwatchers went up to the alternate count site and thought the skies would clear - but alas, they did not.  The team took a walk around the lagoon, hoping for a river otter sighting, and were instead entertained by a juvenile and adult Red-tailed Hawk doing barrel rolls and other acrobatics.  Hopefully the fog will clear for Friday's team!<br/>

<p>A beautiful and clear day at our alternate hawkwatching site led to a highly productive day up on the hill. Red-tailed Hawks, mostly juveniles, were streaming by at a 14 bird per hour clip. Two Red-shouldered Hawks came in and allowed close inspection. An assortment of accipiters were spotted. And the seasons first American Kestrel, a female zooming by fast and low, wrapped up the day nicely.      <br/>

<p>First Day Collecting Data!<br/><br/>After being fogged out on the first day of the season, we were wary of the fog that swept down the coast towards us in our first hour, but we were soon treated to bright blue skies and brisk winds that kept the fog away for the rest of the day! Because it was our first day at our alternate hawkwatching site, we spent some time arranging people and scopes to determine the best viewing quadrants and ended up with five viewpoints.<br/><br/>We saw many Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed hawks and one of each common Accipiter species. There were two Peregrines and one Red-shoulder that flew by as well. Hoping for more hawks and clear skies tomorrow!<br/><br/>

<p>The opening day of the 2010 season and not a single migrating raptor to be seen. The fog was low and thick at our alternate hawkwatch site, limiting visibility considerably. Strong winds and a lack of birds forced the team to descend to the Annex, where observers were treated to the comings and goings of a few local Redtails but little else. The day ended at 1 p.m.<br/>

<p>Only a few days to go. Hawkwatch's 2010 season starts on Monday.<br/>

You may have seen one or two test messages on Facebook and Twitter floating by. Please ignore these! I'm just checking that the plumbing still works, so we can publish daily hawkwatch numbers starting from Monday.<br/>
<br/>
2010 is going to be a strange season for GGRO Hawkwatch. Due to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/goga/parknews/2010-0324.htm">ongoing work on Conzelman Road</a>, we don't have access to Hawk Hill on Mondays through Fridays, so we will be counting from a remote alternate site on those days. On weekends, the Hawkwatch team will be on Hawk Hill but access is still prohibited to the general public. The hawkwatching will be different enough from the two locations that we expect our alternate site's data will not be quantitively comparable with past years' data. However, we don't want to pass up the chance to do some regular hawkwatching this season to get a good qualitative feel for the 2010 flight.<br/>
<br/>
Since the public will not be allowed to visit Hawk Hill until possibly November, we are setting up a new public hawkwatching and interpretive site just for weekends in September and October.  Known as the Annex, this is the large four-bench turnout on Conzelman Road just before you hit the Upper Conzelman Road locked fog gate.  We will station GGRO docents there from 10 am to 2 pm during all clear weekend days in September and October.<br/>
<br/>
We don't know how this will all turn out, but we do know three things: it's going to be an interesting season; there are going to be lots of beautiful raptors in the skies; and you can follow it all here, via the Facebook feed. Stay tuned.<br/>

A rather slow day, with only five species, but we got to see quite a spectacle when two Red-tails talon-grappled and went plummeting down quite a ways before letting go.  We left the hill just in time for it to rain on our cars as we drove back to the office.  Thanks for a great season, Sunday II!  <br/>

<p>A fair number of birds were flying today, and we had a respectable total count.  The bridge Peregrines definitely were today's highlight--we saw them a total of three times, capped by the pair driving off another adult Peregrine in an extended aerial mobbing.  Today's potluck was also excellent, giving us a solid end to the season.  Good luck tomorrow on the last day of Hawkwatch 2009!<br/>

<p>The day did not start well--fog prevented us from getting up to the hill until 10:20 and then we saw just one bird before 11am. That translates to 0.025 raptors per hour, if you care to do the math.  Luckily, the food (and drink) and company was great and the birds picked up as the day wore on.  <br/><br/>Though we didn't see a huge number of raptors, we saw a good diversity: 10 species, including an adult Golden Eagle and juvie Ferruginous Hawk.  Unfortunately, both of these birds appeared at the same time and in the same scope field (until they flew in opposite directions), so we had to split our attention between the two!  That's all for Thursday II.  Until next year.<br/>

<p>Today was a slow but otherwise pleasant day on Hawk Hill. The day started and ended with a whimper (16 and 6 raptors seen in the first and last hours, respectively) but did pack a bit of a bang in the middle: we saw an adult Bald Eagle, which was the first seen from the hill in a couple of years. (Thanks to the banders for pointing that out to us!) As the bird remained in (and subsequently above) North Saddle we didn't get a great look, but it was certainly worth seeing.<br/><br/>Also, thanks to everyone who brought food and drink -- the potluck dress rehearsal was a smashing success and certainly helped to pass the time!<br/>

<p>Today started slowly, with Turkey Vultures dominating the skies and, consequently, the data sheet.  Just as we were mentally preparing ourselves for a slow, albeit gorgeous, day up on the hill, the call of "Prairie!" rang out from West.  As eyes widened in disbelief, heads swiveled northward to check nonetheless.  And what to our wondering eyes should appear but a beautiful Prairie Falcon coursing across Middle Kingdom!  Then it put on a wonderful display of aerobatics over POAK until it tired of this game several minutes later.  Getting such a great look at a Prairie this late was great, and we were feeling pretty good.  But the birds weren't done with us yet...<br/><br/>Then came our second airborne falcon species of the day: the bridge Peregrines took off from the North Tower and decided to show off for us over Hawk Hill.  They circled overhead for about 5 minutes, taking a number of passes so close that you could see the barring with the naked eye.  And after they circled up, one of them dove on a number of birds before they disappeared over Slacker.<br/><br/>Within 15 minutes, our third and fourth falcon species showed themselves.  (Yes, a four falcon day!)  It started when a lone Merlin with a bunch of attitude chased a White-tailed Kite right up over Hawk Hill.  It then proceeded to hit everything in site, including a perched Kestrel (number 4!).  After driving off all the raptors, he turned his attention to the resident ravens and roughed them up a bit too.  And then just for good measure, he circled overhead for a few minutes to make sure that none of them came back!  (Indeed, it was a good hour or so before we saw those ravens again!)<br/><br/>Sitting with four falcons, we didn't think the day could get much better.  But again the birds proved us wrong: a dark juvie Redtail stooping from above eye-level down into the valley (1000+ ft) just to harass a juvie Harrier; an adult female Harrier that stooped into (and then out of) POAK; another pass by the bridge Peregrines; a great look at a dark morph adult Redtail circling over Hawk Hill; and even another Prairie!  It was definitely a different bird, meaning that there were more Prairies than Merlins today--not your every day count.<br/><br/>By the end of the day, the clicking of camera shutters had become as much a natural part of the Hawk Hill experience as the interminable tunnel flutist.  And that was truly music to our ears.<br/>

<p>Weatherwise, it was such a lovely day.<br/><br/>The morning show consisted of huge flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons snaking and twisting in the distance.  In the afternoon we were treated with flight displays executed by an adult Red-tailed Hawk. He or she was calling repeatedly while porpoising (flying upward, then stooping down only to swoop upwards again).  Otherwise it was consistently slow today.  <br/>

<p>So there we were, minding our own business, and enjoying what was a very pleasant day weather-wise on Hawk Hill, when the first signs of trouble appeared: a mob of ravens congregating right over our heads.  Initially, we suspected nothing, no doubt as they intended.  But our ignorance in this case was not bliss--we soon found ourselves under attack!<br/><br/>&lt;cue "Ride of the Valkyries"&gt;<br/><br/>Out of the clear blue sky they dove; what terrifying patterns they wove!  Soon we were showered by fur from a less-fortunate cur (of the rabbit-sort, dear sir).  We thankfully escaped with nary a scrape, but ne'er will look at a raven the same.<br/>

<p>It was a pretty solid day for Red-tails. There were a few great Peregrine fly-bys early on as well. Then right at lunch time we had our pizza-bird pizza delivered by Mr. Fish himself. What little wind we had left us at the end of the day and the hawks left with it. So we just soaked up the sun for an hour and a half and then left ourselves.<br/>

<p>A very nice day on the hill for November.  The weather was just about perfect for human comfort, and we saw a respectable number of birds.  Our day was highlighted early on by two juvie balds that came around the corner in south and then rose up in Kirby Cove in concurrent hours.  The day slowed down in the afternoon, but we did get to see a Prairie Falcon around 3pm (courtesy of SLAK).<br/>

We had fun watching the peregrines fly close to our vantage point and harassing one unfortunate Red-tail.  Our day was also enlivened by the appearance of a bobcat below us on the rifle range.<br/>

<p>Red-tailed Hawks just barely won out against the Turkey Vultures today with a 6 point spread.The two local adult RTs spent quite a bit of their time stilling above us and showing off their superb aeronautical skills. We were all impressed. They also chased away and intimidated the juvenile RTs that came within their range of view. Ravens flew by in groups executing barrel rolls and steep dives. It was an acrobatic and athletic showing by the raptors on this Friday the 13th.  <br/>

<p>Did you know that White-tailed Kites don't actually kite?  They hover.  Human-made kites, on the other hand, do kite.  If that's too confusing, just remember the helpful acronym: WTKDAKTH -- HMKOTOHDK.  Personally, we find saying this five times fast really helps it stick in our brains.<br/><br/><br/><br/>  <br/>

<p>Nice day, few raptors.  <br/><br/>The wind had a strong North component.  The skies were clear.  Everything was set up perfectly.  Still, the hawks were few.  We got a few beautiful dark morph Red-tailed Hawks and a lovely look at a White-tailed Kite at the end of the day.  In our last hour and a half we saw 6 raptors. 6 raptors.  <br/><br/>I think I'll end today's post with Barbara's heavenly Almond Cake recipe:<br/>-Melt butter in oven in the pan you will be baking the cake in.<br/>-Mix 3 eggs, 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 3 tsp almond extract, and the melted butter from the pan.<br/>- Sprinkle with sliced almonds then bake at 350 F for 50 mins and voila!

<p>Return of the Turkey Vulture!<br/><br/>Following yesterday's rainout, the TVs were back in business today.  Like Thursday, it did feel somewhat like a TVwatch, as they comprised almost half of our total sightings.  Redtails also contributed heavily, but this mix was leavened with a good sprinkling of other species to make things interesting.<br/><br/>Of particular note was the Merlin which hung around above Hawk Hill for several minutes before taking off, giving us all great looks.  We don't know why he wasn't feeling up to speed, but perhaps he was still sleepy--passing by around 9:40, he was one of our first sightings of the day.  We also got to watch a pair of Peregrines duke it out, with a smaller male dive-bombing a larger female for a good number of minutes.  And, perhaps inspired by this display of acrobatics, an adult sharpie dug out her best peregrine impression, plummeting hundreds of feet in mere seconds.<br/>

<p>We regret to report that today's Hawkwatch was replaced by a Vulturewatch.  More than half of the birds we saw (and we didn't even break 200 sightings!) were Turkey Vultures.  The threat of rain seemed to keep most of the raptors out of the sky.  On the plus side, that meant that we had plenty of time to admire the dramatic play of sunlight, clouds, and rainbows.  Our last birds of the day were a pair of Peregrine Falcons straight overhead...not a bad way to end a slow day. <br/>

<p>THE PIZZA BIRD HAS ARRIVED!  <br/><br/>It was a hot, still, slow day on the hill. Not necessarily the kind of day on which you would to expect to see anything out of the ordinary. But lo and behold, an oddly colorful low-soaring Buteo was spotted in Kirby Cove in the first half hour. It was an adult Ferruginous Hawk with red and white all over. We were flying pretty high on that sighting for the rest of the morning, but the hot hot heat and the slow trickle of birds seemed to be getting everyone's spirits down by the afternoon. Finally we started to see some flurries of Red-tails come through.  Then there was a dark morph RT that didn't look quite right. It was another Ferrug!  My oh my how we all celebrated. But wait, another dark bird had arrived during the commotion. It was all the way on the other side of the north quadrant. We thought it must be the same Ferrug, but how had it ended up over there and now the wing tips are different and what are those....... CARPAL PATCHES!<br/><br/>I guess a week of waiting and hoping has finally paid off.<br/>We are gratified.<br/><br/><br/>

<p>Today was a Red-tailed Hawk day. We saw a fabulous variety of plumages in our many adult and juvenile RTs.  Some so light they lacked a belly-band and some so chocolate that we couldn't see their patagials. Add to that my personal favorites, the intermediate morphs. Anywho, 'twas a good day even though the hawks quit an hour early on us (they didn't get the Daylight Savings Time heads up). Got a little sunburned too. November eh? This is my kind of month.<br/><br/><br/>ERRATA:<br/><br/>I have been politely informed that an error was made in the "Thursday, Oct. 29th" blog posting.  The Northern Goshawk was first spotted in the East Quadrant, not in the West Quadrant as was written. There it stayed for the duration of the sighting. I apologize for any personal injury I may have caused by publishing false facts; I will certainly keep my compass with me from now on.<br/>

<p>If someone had asked you yesterday how many Accipiter species GGRO Hawkwatchers had seen on the hill this season, you would have answered "two."  However, if someone asked you that same question today (or any day hereafter) you would have to say "THREE!"  West quadrant pointed out a red-shoulder sized accipiter shortly after eleven.  With the help of everyone else's eyes we were able to classify it as a juvenile goshawk.  That's right, we saw a Northern Goshawk--the king of Accipiters.  Albeit the bird was pretty far out so the looks weren't as good as they could have been, but it was still a most momentous moment.<br/>

<p>Today was a lovely clear day... except for the wind.  When we first got up to the hill, we had winds gusting up to 33.1 mph!  But luckily it abated as the day went on, leaving us to deal with gusts of a mere 17 mph toward the end.  We had several interesting sightings, including an adult Golden Eagle and a few Peregrines and White-tailed Kites.  A very cold, but satisfied team.<br/>

<p>What a windy day!  Scopes were flying, chairs were tipping over, and Hawkwatchers were bundled up like Penguin watchers.  We had hundreds of Band-tailed Pigeons flying in doughnuts and helices.  There was a Peregrine Falcon trying to clear the skies of the whole Headlands, diving on Red-tails, Ravens, Turkey Vultures, and Accipiters.  Four Golden Eagles soared over Hawk Hill (fortunately all those layers we were wearing provided a bit of cushioning for our necks).  At the very end of the day, we had a distant but identifiable Short-eared Owl.<br/>

<h2><a name='20091026'/>Monday, October 26, 2009</h2>
<p>Today started off a bit windy, then the wind died down to a nicer breeze, and brought with it a few interesting birds in the early to mid afternoon.  We were treated to a great view of a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk who let us take a nice long look as it leisurely made its way to San Francisco.  We also had a juvenile Peregrine - very dark in color - come by and treat us to a nice show for a bit.  Otherwise, we had quite the day of Red-tails, reaching nearly 200 counted!  Good luck to the Tuesday 1 team, I hear it's supposed to get windy!<br/>

<h2><a name='20091025'/>Sunday, October 25, 2009</h2>
<p>The day started out slow, except for the juvenile Peregrine we spotted as soon as we started.  It picked up a bit, as did the heat, with lots of Red-tails and a fair number of Sharpies.  The highlight of the day was a leucistic adult Red-tailed Hawk that we spotted far out before it came in closer and flew over Slaker Blind.  The bird actually sparked a lively discussion as to the definitions of partially albino, partially leucistic, and incomplete albinism.  Currently the team is still debating as I type.  All in all, the weather was nice for our second day of Raptor Fest!<br/>

<p>Started off with a temperature inversion: just us, Mt Tam and Twin Peaks above a sea of clouds (and sadly few raptors to share them with). But it picked up later. The highlight of the day (and for most of us, the season) was a young Ferruge who gave us a ten minute promenade up and down Rodeo Valley.

<p>Today was long-awaited for Wednesday IIs Team.  After a string of depressing fog outs, we enjoyed our first full day on the hill this season!  We went up in full fog, determined to blast it away with our own sheer will.  And it worked!  By 11:00 it was clear for miles around.  <br/><br/>The birds were also fashionably late.  We started to see Merlins, and Red-shoulders and Harriers (oh my!).  We also saw two parallel Vs of flying geese.  In one of these Vs  there flew a lone Band-tailed Pigeon doing its best to stay in formation.  <br/><br/>By the end of it all we had that good old satisfied feeling of having completed a full days workfinally.<br/>

<p>Una mas rain out. We stood on the hill amid sporadic showers but were not rewarded this time with the oodles of raptors we wished we would see. We eventually decided that the birds must not be in the mood to fly today. We retreated to sunny Fort Cronkhite. There we witnessed a beautiful adult male Northern Harrier hunting over the hills behind 1064. He was promptly mobbed by a raven and they both disappeared behind a hill. We all had a smile on our faces after the sighting. <br/>'Twas a good way to end the day and perhaps a good omen for Tuesday. Go Hawks Go!  <br/><br/><br/>

<p>The day began promising with some fog, but signs of clearing.  Good visibility and lots of hawks from ten thru noon.  Then, the fog monster came back with a vengeance.  Howling winds and tons of the gray stuff.  You know it's bad when Steve and Tim leave!  We gave up at one and shuffled off the the Hill to contemplate this affront to humanity.<br/><br/>Hope your day was better!<br/><br/>

<p>14 SPECIES!!!!  Including both eagles!  Our adult golden and juvie bald were especially kind, consenting to flybys of Hawk Hill and giving us all great looks.  The Bald Eagle even passed right over a kids group being introduced to raptors--a pretty good introduction, if you ask me.<br/><br/>And to make matters even better, the weather was great!  A little hot to start out, but the breeze picked up a bit within the hour and kept the temp in the 70s all day.  Not much more that you can ask for--great weather and great birds.<br/>

<p>Our brave team went up the hill first thing this morning and held an organized, 4-quadrant count for a two full hours.  We stood in the rain and fog and saw but one bird of prey.  We, along with our Hawkwatch director, decided to scrap the count due to low visibility and bad weather.  And so we spent the rest of the afternoon all cozied up in 1064, talking about raptors.  Not too shabby.  Better luck to tomorrow's crew.<br/>

<p>Today was better than yesterday in terms of number of raptors, but it was still a slow and chilly Hawkwatch.  The strangest part of it was that everyone wanted to get to North quadrant to warm up!  South quadrant was actually the coldest area today, with the wind coming in gusts from the south, increasing as the day went on. <br/><br/>We did have a few good sightings - one early in the day with an adult Peregrine chasing a flock of pigeons, only to get chased out of the area by another adult Peregrine!  Other notable events were the late Osprey sighting, and another adult Peregrine chasing off a juvenile Red-tail.<br/>

<p>Today was a bitterly cold day, with the cloud cover a bit higher than yesterday, but luckily almost no winds.  We had few birds - only 83 total - but quite a few species for such a low count.  11 species seen, including a White-tailed Kite and a couple Merlins.  One of the highlights of the day was spotting the dark morph adult Red-tail that was perched on a pole for a while, looking about as cold as we were!  The day ended with bird number dropping again, but that was expected considering the Blue Angels buzzed us several times after 3 o'clock came around. <br/>

<h2><a name='20091010'/>Saturday, October 10, 2009</h2>
<p>Today was certainly a silver lining sort of day.  And I mean that in every sense of the word: we were literally in the silver lining of one cloud or another over the entirety of the day, which in turn led to the metaphoric meaning by keeping the Blue Angels and their would-be viewers out of our hair.  So rather than being inundated with loud visitors and louder planes, we were instead choked by fog and loud winds.<br/><br/>Cloud cover remained greater than 95% all day with visibility falling at the end of the day.  This decrease in visibility corresponded with an increase in wind speed, which was approximately 25mph on the North Platform before we called it quits for the day.  I never knew silver linings were so darn cold...<br/><br/>On the other hand, we got absolutely spectacular looks at a number of Peregrines.  One of them hung out in North for quite a while and then flew pretty close by the hill on its way out.  We also had a good number of Merlins, and again, a couple of them hung out in North.  Those looks salvaged what was otherwise a dishearteningly dismal day.  <br/><br/>(Even the fleet week festivities were lame--there were only six small ships and a very short show by the Blue Angels.  In case you care, the line of ships consisted of one Amphibious Transport Dock [LPD-20, USS Green Bay], one Coast Guard High Endurance Cutter [WHEC-719, USCGC Boutwell], three Canadian coastal defense vessels [MM-703, HMCS Edmonton; MM-705, HMCS Whitehorse; and MM-710, HMCS Brandon], and one fire-fighting ship [designation unknown])<br/>

<p>Today was a great day up on Hawk Hill.  The skies were clear with moderate winds.  The day began with much excitement over sightings of wild felines behind Fort Cronkhite.  We were then treated to an early morning Merlin (Quick, what did Allen tell us about small falcons this morning?!?!) up on Hawk Hill and a banded juvenile Red-tailed Hawk that(unsuccessfully) stooped on a covey of quail 20 meters from West quadrant. Other raptor highlights of the day include two dark-morph adult Broad-winged Hawks and a Peregrine Falcon driving a Red-tailed Hawk from its telephone pole perch.   <br/>

<p>Today started fairly foggy, but not so much so that we couldn't start on time.  Well, that is, "on time" give or take a morning meeting!  There was slow but steady clearing throughout the day, with a gradual warming trend as well--all in all, a pleasant day.<br/><br/>We saw most of the usual suspects today, excepting Osprey.  And excepting Merlin as well until 3:25 when one showed up right overhead!  No one knows for sure how it got there (we're suspecting either teleportation or black magic), but we did see it leave--chased away by a stooping Peregrine!  A great way to end the day.<br/><br/>The other sightings of note were two close encounters with the elusive Grey Ghost.  Both adult male NOHAs showed up in the rifle-range/rocky ridge/Hawk blind area and stuck around for a while, giving us some pretty good looks.  Truly spectacular birds!  <br/>

<p>The fog monster came back to get us today.  Still, this was one of Wednesday II's better days on the hill.  The lil' falcon presentation at the morning meeting perfectly preceded some lovely merlin fly-bys.  In order to make sure they were counted, most of our Accipiters flew between us and the fog wall.  Many were identified without binoculars.  We got some great looks at adult Coops and Sharpies (they are out there!).  <br/><br/>In our one hour of clarity (12:30pm-1:30pm) there flew a huge gaggle of Greater White-fronted Geese.  Counters approximated their number at 122.  We unfortunately had to call the day a bit early due to weather, heading down the hill at around 2:30.  <br/>

<p>Is it possible to have too much good weather?  That is the prevailing theory as to why the bird count dropped off today--no fog means no backup of hawks which means no super day.  The species count also dropped--no Broadwings for the first time in over a week and no eagles either.<br/><br/>In this case, though, I'm not complaining.  The weather was excellent today, making for a very pleasant day on the hill.  Though we didn't see a huge number of birds, the flow was steady and we didn't get too bored.  And at any rate, it was probably good that things weren't too crazy, as we only had 5 people on the Tuesday II team! <br/><br/>Fortunately we received invaluable help from Tim, Steve, Nick, Harv, and Corinne, allowing us to keep everything covered.  With their help, our team picked up seven Merlins, a couple of which gave us close fly-bys.  Good stuff.<br/>

<p>Due to a broken foot and an attack of the cold we had a bare bones team today.  The four of us met at 1064 and headed up to the hill at 9:15 to get our sunny day started.  After a while our support began to show up.  We gained three more teammates and then the regulars waltzed up the hill.  Then two Hawkwatchers from other teams came and helped us out.  And then we were 9!  That was about the time we saw our FIRST GOLDEN EAGLE OF THE SEASON.  In the next hour we saw our SECOND GOLDEN EAGLE OF THE SEASON!  The birds were almost certainly different individuals since one had noticeably more white on its dorsal wing than the other (both were juveniles).  We had a lot of high birds in the afternoon, dropping down into the 5th quadrant from above. Still plenty of Accipiter ID practice to be had.  Thanks for a great count day Monday II Team!  <br/>

<h2><a name='20091002'/>Friday, October 02, 2009</h2>
<p>Hawkwatching today gave me a distinct feeling of deja vu--I could have sworn that YESTERDAY was the 13 species day with 420ish sightings and a Bald Eagle.  Well, crazily enough, so was today!  <br/><br/>Our Bald Eagle sighting was particularly memorable, because we (that is, Steve) came across it while following a Prairie Falcon.  That's right, a Prairie and a Bald in the same field of view!  Pretty crazy, that's for sure.  And then for good measure, the juvie Bald circled down in Kirby Cove for over 5 minutes, giving us absolutely stunning looks.  <br/><br/>Those sightings, coupled with a few PEFAs, Merlins, and Osprey, brought us up to 12 species.  We sat there for a couple of hours, our bright hopes for tying the species count slowly dimming.  Then, at 3:15, a miracle!  Herb spotted a female Kes, bringing us up to that (currently) hallowed number.  And just for good measure, two more came over just before 3:30.  Apparently the kestrels heard and heeded our pleas, unlike their traitorous brethren (White-tailed Kite, Ferrug, Swanie, Golden, Gos, Rough-leg, Caracara, etc).  Perhaps tomorrow?<br/><br/>But given the very similar nature of the past four days, I think we should just call off the hawkwatch tomorrow and say there were 422ish sightings of 12 species for a total of 71 HpH.  (That is, unless there's fog, which given Saturday I's luck is a distinct possibility.  I'm pulling for the 12 species day, though.)  These 12 species will probably include an eagle.  I'm gonna go out on a limb and say Golden, because another Bald would just be too weird. <br/>

<p>The Power of Positive Thinking: lessons to live by<br/><br/>Positive attitudes yield positive results.  Nowhere is this statement more applicable than with hawkwatching. Thursday I Hawkwatch Team arrived with smiles and enthusiastic greetings. Such optimism has already led to their owning of the season high raptor count and today caused them to tie the season high species count. Crowning the day were the Bald Eagle and Swainie sightings just after noon. <br/><br/>The team enjoyed a warm (but not hot) morning and afternoon with excellent visibility; this was clearly caused by their sunny dispositions.  Powered by delicious corn chowder, the hawkwatchers spotted and passed speck birds with ease.  Truly, it was an honor to witness the power of positive thinking in action. Go team.

<p>The Coops are coming!  For the first time in several weeks, Sharpies were out-numbered by their larger relative.  Fortunately, the weather was better than predicted so we were able to get up on Hawk Hill right away.  We were treated to 46 raptor sightings in our first 15 minutes.  Immediately on cresting the hill, we witnessed a series of aerial dogfights between a congress of ravens and a cast of Red-tails (those are the appropriate terms for groups of the above birds).  The raptors dwindled in the afternoon and Accipiter identification was made even more complicated by the effect of high winds on flight attitude and shape.       <br/>

<p>We started the day with great hopes: the hill was clear, the forecast was good, and yesterday had a very respectable day.  Unfortunately, our hopes (and hawk count) followed the wind speed (quite low) instead of the temperature (not quite so low).  The wind picked up about five hours too late (around 3:00), resulting in a sweaty day with not all that many birds.<br/><br/>On the plus side, we did see 24 Broadwings and some really fast-flying Merlins.  Our "tweet sheet" also had a good day, perhaps because there weren't that many hawks around!  We saw hundreds of Vaux's Swifts and were buzzed by a flock of 25ish Black Swifts.  So that was sure cool, though more raptors would have been nice.  Maybe tomorrow.  (But bring lots of water just in case.)<br/>

<p>Today we were engulfed by fog and thus unable to conduct the hawkwatch.  Alas, even the annex was socked in, and so we took a nice walk around the lagoon instead.  We saw some nice shorebirds and ducks, and even a couple of raptors.  But the organism we spotted the most of was the "disgruntled hawkwatcher."  (Both the GGRO and independent subspecies were in evidence.)  They shambled about the shore in small to medium disheartened flocks, moving largely without purpose.  Curiously, many individuals appeared ready for sunny weather and good visibility, sporting all manner of optical equipment and sun protection ... adaptations that made little sense given local conditions. Apparently the lagoon is the sub-optimal habitat for this species.<br/><br/>Better luck tomorrow.<br/>

<p>The day started out pretty foggy, so we went on a walk around the lagoon.  Several shorebird sightings, a brief glimpse of a kestrel, and two Red-shouldereds (adult and juvenile) gave us a beautiful show, allowing us to compare the two ages.  <br/><br/>We heard tales of a bit of blue showing, so we headed up to the Annex in anticipation.  Unfortunately, when we got there it was clear that the Hill was still fogged in.  It would briefly appear before disappearing into haze for a while, so we stayed in the Annex.  But we had some lovely finds!  A Broad-winged and an adult Peregrine appeared in the skies at the same time, and the Peregrine gave us quite a show while diving at a dark Red-tail.  However, the Hill did refuse to clear up by 1, so we had to call it a day.<br/>

<p>Today hawkwatch's fog intern (Robyn) and sun intern (Nathan) combined forces to produce a half-foggy day.  Half in the sense that it was clear above and foggy below--an "A" in the lingo of the GGRO.  After the day ended, we decided that the sun was ascendant today because Robyn was tired.  (Though wouldn't sleep deprivation make everything a little more foggy?  Make it seem all hazy?)<br/><br/>Regardless, we had a great day on the hill, seeing 13 species of raptor!  We had a four falcon day accented by a good number of Red-shoulders, a Broadwing, and two kites.  Perhaps this will win the diversity competition?  We'll see....  <br/>

We had fog below us for most of the day by the sky cleared enough for us to see 360 degrees until about 2pm. We had a lovely visit from five Broad-winged Hawks today.  Only one was a juvenile.  They were very obliging and circled around the golden gate for the better part of an hour.  Isn't it great when they do that?  We saw more adult Red-tailed Hawks than juveniles today.

When we crested the platform at 10am it was blue sky and sunshine all over.  Raptors flew by in a steady flow.  We found a Broad-winged Hawk in a kettle of Red-tails and Turkey Vultures.  What appeared to be the same juvenile Broad-wing hung out in the headlands for a while, visiting most of the quadrants by the end of the day.  There were also a few kettle of accipiters, in which Sharp-shinned hawks always outnumbered the Cooper's Hawks.  At around 3pm the fog decided to come back in and spoil our party.

<p>Today was truly a smoking day on the hill.  And I mean that both figuratively and literally.  We scrambled up the hill filled with anticipation as visions of yesterday's count (690) danced in our heads.  And indeed the day started out well, with good numbers of accips and red-tails.  We also had a fair number of red-shoulders, a couple of them beautiful adult birds in all their glory.<br/><br/>But just as we were sure that the curse of Friday I had finally been lifted, disaster struck!  Visitors and hawkwatchers alike spotted a small fog-like cloud forming far down below Conzelman Road, to the west of Kirby Cove.  At first, we suspected little.  But as time went on, the harmless little cloud grew and grew, turning into an ominous pillar of smoke reaching up to engulf the Golden Gate.<br/><br/>Binoculars and scopes revealed orange flames at the base, and so we alerted 1064, and Jill in turn called the fire department.  Soon after, sirens began winding their way up Conzelman and a Coast Guard helicopter appeared to circle the expanding plume.  Though the fire was small, it was inaccessible to land-based personnel, and so backup was summoned in the form of aircraft and a Coast Guard vessel.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, this required us to leave the hill--airborne fire-suppressant is not always the most accurate and the park service didn't want us anywhere near the area.  So much to our dismay, we were chivvied down the hill and told to leave the area via the one-way road.  Though the fire was mostly out by 2pm, the road was still closed, and thus we called it a day.  The day certainly didn't lack excitement, though we would have hoped for a few more hours on the hill!<br/>

<p>Today it happened.  We wished the morning fog away and it worked!  And then the hawks came.  They came by the hundreds.   And we, the Thursday I Hawkwatch team, were ready.  Accipiter after Accipiter identified with grace and relative ease (at least the ones that weren't undoc or unidentified).  Each quadrant's birds were passed with consummate skill.  It was beautiful, a well orchestrated ballet.  <br/><br/>Here are some of the highlights:<br/><br/>The sharpie season high was quadrupled. Merlins are starting to come through by the more than ones.  We were getting kettles of ten or so birds with two to four species each.  <br/><br/>Special thanks to the bringers of the soup, pumpkin bread, zucchini bread, watermelon slices, and falcon fudge.<br/>

<p>Lots of fog today, unfortunately.  The team was hopeful that it would clear up, but at times it just seemed to be getting worse!  We did make the walk up to the Hill, but were unable see even a stone's throw away.  We did have two sharpies come whizzing by really close, but other than that all we saw was white.  <br/>

<p>Although we got fogged out in the afternoon, most of the morning was clear, pleasant, and hawk-filled.  We were lucky enough to get close-up views of a Merlin and a juvenile Northern Harrier.  When the fog came in at 1:45 we attempted to wait it out.  We told stories and ate cookies around the northern platform. After half an hour we were still fogged in so we packed up our scopes and headed down the hill.<br/>

<p>Fogged out again!  We went out to the Annex for a couple hours, although when we first arrived we couldn't even see the trees 50 meters away!  It backed off a little, but came back in again before we called it a day.  Few birds to be seen at the Annex through the fog - mostly Turkey Vultures and one or two Red-tails - although we had a Great Horned Owl fly over! But mostly just fog.  <br/>

<p>It was a relatively slow day on the Hill.  The weather was overcast, and very odd - we could see almost to San Jose in the south, but couldn't even see Mount Tam in the north!  The visitors numbered many more than the hawks, unfortunately.  We watched as the rain crept up on the banding blinds, and eventually cut our day short as it finally reached us.  <br/>

<h2><a name='20090912'/>Saturday, September 12, 2009</h2>
<p>Today we were weathered out.  I say "weathered out" rather than "fogged out" because dense, ground-level fog was only one of the many impediments to hawkwatch today--there was also a very low cloud ceiling, rain, lightning, and even a little bit of hail!  It seems that the fog got together with all of its buddies and conspired to keep us not only off of the hill, but cooped up in 1064.<br/>
<br/>
We still had a good time, though.  Some get-to-know you stuff at the beginning, which was quite helpful for those of us new to the team.  I then did my level best to impersonate Allen in the morning meeting by dragging out the accipiter education module as long as I could.  Alas, I don't think I remembered all of his tangents.  Too bad--they would have come in handy today!<br/>
<br/>
When I finally ran out of steam, the hawkwatchers departed for some hiking while I worked on switching the display case to peak birds (huzzah!).  Their quick return (prompted by the aforementioned precipitation) forced a showing of Raptor Force, which basically compares military planes to birds of prey.  What it lacked in real educational value it certainly made up for in cool footage of birds and planes doing crazy acrobatics and flying really fast!  Which, incidentally, will be ours to experience first-hand in just a couple of weeks--I'm sure y'all are looking forward to that!<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, here's hoping for some clear days with moderate winds and many birds.<br/>

Highlights include an adult red-shoulder, a sharp-shinned that came right over the hill, and a perched mystery bird in South quadrant that we have tentatively identified as a Great-Horned Owl.  Don't forget sunscreen, water, and layers when you come up on the hill!<br/>

<p>The day started out a bit sketchy with fog, but it cleared quickly and we were up on the hill by 10:30.  The Red-tails were giving us quite a spectacular show  52 in the first half hour!  But our beautiful sunny day quickly turned back into fog, getting worse and worse until we were forced to admit defeat a mere 2.5 hours after making it to the top  visibility had dropped to much less than half a mile in all directions!<br/>

<p>Fog bookended an otherwise pretty good day. Visibility started off quite poor, but cleared a bit early afternoon, enough so that we got to see a number of falcons. In addition to close flybys by a number of Kestrels, we were also treated to the sight of one of the bridge Peregrines (presumably) defending its territory against an encroaching Prairie. The aerial acrobatics were quite spectacular, though unfortunately distant over Slacker Ridge. Other than that, lots of Red-tails and a good number of Coops. Hopefully the fog will stay farther out tomorrow!<br/>

<p>Apparently the hawks didnt get the whole labor day off memo. Lucky for us, because we saw lots of cool birds. There are two reasons to write in all caps today: it was a FOUR FALCON DAY and we saw our FIRST BROAD-WINGED HAWK OF THE SEASON! We certainly made good use of our hats, sunscreen, and extra water. All in all, it was a lovely way to spend the holiday.<br/>

I emerged from the NPS dorm this morning amazed and dismayed &mdash; it was cold and foggy with Hawk Hill completely obscured!  So after an enlightening morning lesson, we dispirited hawkwatchers birded around the lagoon.  Don't get me wrong&mdash;we did see some interesting stuff, but they weren't our beloved raptors. <br />
 <br />
But around noon, a miracle!  The fog began to lift with such speed that we were still on our way back to 1064 when Hawk Hill completely cleared.  After grabbing our gear and throwing it (and ourselves) into vehicles, we raced up to the top.  To be surrounded by fog.  Completely (maximum visibility of &lt;1 mile).  Dismay, made even more vicious by the knowledge that somewhere above Slacker, a Golden Eagle waited (reported by other GGRO volunteers).  By the time the fog cleared (clearing being a relative term), the eagle was, alas, gone.  Instead we had to make do with a less sought-after season first&mdash;20+ mph winds!  Gotta love shaking scopes and binoculars... <br />
 <br />
However, these winds did clear out the fog, and by 2, Mt. Diablo was intermittently visible.  We saw a fair number of hawks, and were delighted by three juvenile coops that hung out right above us for several minutes.  At any rate, a much better day than we had anticipated! <br />

An absolutely gorgeous day on the hill&mdash;the temperature was mostly pleasant, and the breeze was strong enough to be quite refreshing. Great visibility too&mdash;all the way to the geysers beyond the North Saddle (66 miles away). So the landscapes were great, but unfortunately not well populated with raptors: only had double digits of turkey vultures and red-tails. However, we did see nine kestrels, getting a number of good looks. And as mentioned earlier, the weather was absolutely amazing. So being up there was by no means trying! An excellent way to spend the day. <br />

Things looked pretty foggy at the beginning of the day, but we were able to get up on the Hill around 11:30. At that point it was still pretty foggy, but we saw an adult Red-shouldered Hawk pretty soon after getting set up! For the next few hours the fog was in and out, but around 2:30 it started getting pretty clear. The most exciting part of the day was when the fog cleared, allowing the helicopter to finally start doing its job. We got to watch as it flew one of the power towers down to just beside the stables. We watched it avidly to make sure no hawks were in the way (and to see if it dropped the tower), and luckily no raptors were in sight.  <br />

Despite high hopes of no fog, today was completely fogged out. We made it out to the Annex for about an hour and a half, surrounded by mostly white. Most of the time we couldn't even see the Golden Gate Bridge, and we once caught one brief glimpse of a very white-looking Hawk Hill. We managed to see a few Red-tails and Turkey Vultures through the fog, and one Osprey came flying right overhead, but that was it for the day, unfortunately. <br />

Another scorcher today, but not quite as hot as it was yesterday, for which we were most thankful! Unfortunately, the air was relatively still all day, resulting in few raptors. But not a bad day to be on the hill, especially since we had plenty of ice-cold water in the GGRO cooler. <br />

All in all a very HOT, still, slow day on the hill, but we count ourselves fortunate to have made it up for a full six hours of hawk watching. We saw 110 birds of six species, including one beautiful dark morph adult red-tail, three male American Kestrels, three female American Kestrels and one red-shouldered hawk. We hit 95.5 degrees, so don.t forget water, hat and sunscreen when you come out to join us! <br />

Our very first fog-free day!  Well, not entirely fog-free, but we did get up onto the hill promptly at 9:30 for the first time this season.  And what a day it was!  We saw TEN species today, getting to the double digits in species much earlier than the past two years.  We were sitting happy with eight species at 3pm (a few early ospreys, a bunch of red-shoulders mid-day, some female kestrels in the afternoon, a smattering of standard accipiters, and lots of TVs and red-tails) and getting ready to call it a good day when a white-tailed kite booked it down in front of Slacker Ridge and we saw two peregrines&mdash;one on the bridge, one popping up far out over Wolfback Ridge.<br />
<br />
The afternoon was a lot slower bird-wise: as temperatures rose, the hawks settled down.  It was quite warm by the time we quit (89 degrees Fahrenheit), so bring lots of water if you come up to visit or count!  But all in all, a beautiful day to be on the hill.<br />

Weather on the hill was windy and foggy today, but we managed to count hawks from 12:30 until 3pm. The high point of the day was watching two Kestrels for about five minutes until they shot over our heads and sped off into the south Quadrant. Only three species seen today - Turkey Vultures, Redtails, and Kestrels. <br />

The day started out foggy, but looked like it might clear up soon, so after a morning meeting we headed up to the Hill.  We arrived in fog, but walked up all the same, only to face more fog.  It occasionally started to clear, but seemed to always end up foggier than before.  Tired of the fog, we headed to the Annex to see some birds – mostly a few Red-tails and Turkey Vultures, although we had one Peregrine sighting!  Eventually we did have to conclude that the fog was not going to lift, and ended our day around 1 pm.<br />

The  Monday 2 Hawkwatch team braved the fog and wind this morning in order to  squeeze in an hour and 45 minutes of observation. Unfortunately they were forced to come down  early due to fog-out at 1 pm. What did  they report as their most exciting moment? A banana slug on the road up to Hawk  Hill! Understandably they then had to  relocate said slug to the vegetation off of the road. The slug was first sighted by Suzanne, a UCSC  alum. Coincidence? I think not. <br />

Hooray! Though the morning began in a foggy way, the  clouds eventually parted over Hawk Hill and we were able to Hawkwatch from  11:30am -3:30pm today. Maximum  visibility hung at around 2 miles for the duration of our stay. We bundled up and hunkered down for a slow  but exciting early-season view of the flyway.  A juvenile Northern Harrier and Cooper's Hawks was probably the best  looks of the day. But try as we may, our  other raptor-ing successes could best be described as okay (as the numbers  below will display). But hey, we love  being out in the headlands anyway! Yay.<br />

Fogged out again.  Bummer.  It was too foggy to see anything from the Annex so we went down to the lagoon.  Our day leader put us through Scoping 101 and simulated a hawkwatch so that the apprentices could familiarize themselves with the data sheet.  We saw turkey vultures, red-tails, an osprey, a male kestrel, and an adult red-shoulder.<br />

                    FIRST DAY ON THE HILL! FIRST DAY ON THE HILL!  YAY! When we arrived for our morning meeting today we were pleased to see that the fog had finally lifted and Hawk Hill was visible.  While it was overcast with NW winds for most of the day we did see some sunshine in the afternoon.  In our full 5 1/2 hour day we managed to count 189 raptors.  That amounted to 33.82 hawks/hr.  Our most exciting sightings included, but were not limited to: a triple fly-by of an adult peregrine falcon, 2 dark morph juvie red-tails, 2 Ospreys, and a strafing by a female kestrel on a mission.  We hope tomorrow's crew will be blessed with good weather and see many, many raptors. <br />
