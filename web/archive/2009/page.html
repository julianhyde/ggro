<p>A small team of five made it up to the hill today, to end the 2009 season.  A rather slow day, with only five species, but we got to see quite a spectacle when two Red-tails talon-grappled and went plummeting down quite a ways before letting go.  We left the hill just in time for it to rain on our cars as we drove back to the office.  Thanks for a great season, Sunday II!  <br/>

<p>A fair number of birds were flying today, and we had a respectable total count.  The bridge Peregrines definitely were today's highlight--we saw them a total of three times, capped by the pair driving off another adult Peregrine in an extended aerial mobbing.  Today's potluck was also excellent, giving us a solid end to the season.  Good luck tomorrow on the last day of Hawkwatch 2009!<br/>

<p>The day did not start well--fog prevented us from getting up to the hill until 10:20 and then we saw just one bird before 11am. That translates to 0.025 raptors per hour, if you care to do the math.  Luckily, the food (and drink) and company was great and the birds picked up as the day wore on.  <br/><br/>Though we didn't see a huge number of raptors, we saw a good diversity: 10 species, including an adult Golden Eagle and juvie Ferruginous Hawk.  Unfortunately, both of these birds appeared at the same time and in the same scope field (until they flew in opposite directions), so we had to split our attention between the two!  That's all for Thursday II.  Until next year.<br/>

<p>An extremely cold last day for Wednesday II, with the temperature reaching no higher than 52 degrees fahrenheit, and it was at 48.5 degrees when we left the hill.  A chilly team, but we were warmed by delicious soup to keep us going as we saw few birds go by.  The company was good though, so it made it worth the while.  <br/>

<p>Today was a slow but otherwise pleasant day on Hawk Hill. The day started and ended with a whimper (16 and 6 raptors seen in the first and last hours, respectively) but did pack a bit of a bang in the middle: we saw an adult Bald Eagle, which was the first seen from the hill in a couple of years. (Thanks to the banders for pointing that out to us!) As the bird remained in (and subsequently above) North Saddle we didn't get a great look, but it was certainly worth seeing.<br/><br/>Also, thanks to everyone who brought food and drink -- the potluck dress rehearsal was a smashing success and certainly helped to pass the time!<br/>

<p>Today started slowly, with Turkey Vultures dominating the skies and, consequently, the data sheet.  Just as we were mentally preparing ourselves for a slow, albeit gorgeous, day up on the hill, the call of "Prairie!" rang out from West.  As eyes widened in disbelief, heads swiveled northward to check nonetheless.  And what to our wondering eyes should appear but a beautiful Prairie Falcon coursing across Middle Kingdom!  Then it put on a wonderful display of aerobatics over POAK until it tired of this game several minutes later.  Getting such a great look at a Prairie this late was great, and we were feeling pretty good.  But the birds weren't done with us yet...<br/><br/>Then came our second airborne falcon species of the day: the bridge Peregrines took off from the North Tower and decided to show off for us over Hawk Hill.  They circled overhead for about 5 minutes, taking a number of passes so close that you could see the barring with the naked eye.  And after they circled up, one of them dove on a number of birds before they disappeared over Slacker.<br/><br/>Within 15 minutes, our third and fourth falcon species showed themselves.  (Yes, a four falcon day!)  It started when a lone Merlin with a bunch of attitude chased a White-tailed Kite right up over Hawk Hill.  It then proceeded to hit everything in site, including a perched Kestrel (number 4!).  After driving off all the raptors, he turned his attention to the resident ravens and roughed them up a bit too.  And then just for good measure, he circled overhead for a few minutes to make sure that none of them came back!  (Indeed, it was a good hour or so before we saw those ravens again!)<br/><br/>Sitting with four falcons, we didn't think the day could get much better.  But again the birds proved us wrong: a dark juvie Redtail stooping from above eye-level down into the valley (1000+ ft) just to harass a juvie Harrier; an adult female Harrier that stooped into (and then out of) POAK; another pass by the bridge Peregrines; a great look at a dark morph adult Redtail circling over Hawk Hill; and even another Prairie!  It was definitely a different bird, meaning that there were more Prairies than Merlins today--not your every day count.<br/><br/>By the end of the day, the clicking of camera shutters had become as much a natural part of the Hawk Hill experience as the interminable tunnel flutist.  And that was truly music to our ears.<br/>

<p>Weatherwise, it was such a lovely day.<br/><br/>The morning show consisted of huge flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons snaking and twisting in the distance.  In the afternoon we were treated with flight displays executed by an adult Red-tailed Hawk. He or she was calling repeatedly while porpoising (flying upward, then stooping down only to swoop upwards again).  Otherwise it was consistently slow today.  <br/>

<p>So there we were, minding our own business, and enjoying what was a very pleasant day weather-wise on Hawk Hill, when the first signs of trouble appeared: a mob of ravens congregating right over our heads.  Initially, we suspected nothing, no doubt as they intended.  But our ignorance in this case was not bliss--we soon found ourselves under attack!<br/><br/>&lt;cue "Ride of the Valkyries"&gt;<br/><br/>Out of the clear blue sky they dove; what terrifying patterns they wove!  Soon we were showered by fur from a less-fortunate cur (of the rabbit-sort, dear sir).  We thankfully escaped with nary a scrape, but ne'er will look at a raven the same.<br/>

What little wind we had left us at the end of the day and the hawks left with it. So we just soaked up the sun for an hour and a half and then left ourselves.<br/>

<p>A very nice day on the hill for November.  The weather was just about perfect for human comfort, and we saw a respectable number of birds.  Our day was highlighted early on by two juvie balds that came around the corner in south and then rose up in Kirby Cove in concurrent hours.

<p>Red-tailed Hawks just barely won out against the Turkey Vultures today with a 6 point spread.The two local adult RTs spent quite a bit of their time stilling above us and showing off their superb aeronautical skills. We were all impressed. They also chased away and intimidated the juvenile RTs that came within their range of view. Ravens flew by in groups executing barrel rolls and steep dives. It was an acrobatic and athletic showing by the raptors on this Friday the 13th.  <br/>

<p>Did you know that White-tailed Kites don't actually kite?  They hover.  Human-made kites, on the other hand, do kite.  If that's too confusing, just remember the helpful acronym: WTKDAKTH -- HMKOTOHDK.  Personally, we find saying this five times fast really helps it stick in our brains.<br/><br/><br/><br/>  <br/>

<p>Nice day, few raptors.  <br/><br/>The wind had a strong North component.  The skies were clear.  Everything was set up perfectly.  Still, the hawks were few.

In our last hour and a half we saw 6 raptors. 6 raptors.  <br/><br/>I think I'll end today's post with Barbara's heavenly Almond Cake recipe:<br/>-Melt butter in oven in the pan you will be baking the cake in.<br/>-Mix 3 eggs, 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 3 tsp almond extract, and the melted butter from the pan.<br/>- Sprinkle with sliced almonds then bake at 350 F for 50 mins and voila! You have created the best cake any Hawkwatcher's ever tasted.<br/>

<p>A small team of six made it up the Hill today, to be greeted by beautiful weather and a middling of birds.  In the last half hour, we had five Northern Harriers appear in the sky above us, prompting discussion on what to call a flock of them.  The decision: a hurry of harriers.  All in all, a good day spent in good company.<br/>

<p>Return of the Turkey Vulture!<br/><br/>Following yesterday's rainout, the TVs were back in business today.  Like Thursday, it did feel somewhat like a TVwatch, as they comprised almost half of our total sightings.  Redtails also contributed heavily, but this mix was leavened with a good sprinkling of other species to make things interesting.<br/><br/>Of particular note was the Merlin which hung around above Hawk Hill for several minutes before taking off, giving us all great looks.  We don't know why he wasn't feeling up to speed, but perhaps he was still sleepy--passing by around 9:40, he was one of our first sightings of the day.  We also got to watch a pair of Peregrines duke it out, with a smaller male dive-bombing a larger female for a good number of minutes.  And, perhaps inspired by this display of acrobatics, an adult sharpie dug out her best peregrine impression, plummeting hundreds of feet in mere seconds.<br/>

<p>We regret to report that today's Hawkwatch was replaced by a Vulturewatch.  More than half of the birds we saw (and we didn't even break 200 sightings!) were Turkey Vultures.  The threat of rain seemed to keep most of the raptors out of the sky.  On the plus side, that meant that we had plenty of time to admire the dramatic play of sunlight, clouds, and rainbows.  Our last birds of the day were a pair of Peregrine Falcons straight overhead...not a bad way to end a slow day. <br/>

<p>The fog lifted by eleven but our number of hawks counted did not.  Still we were treated with extraordinary views of a pair of Peregrines hunting pigeons, stooping on Red-tails, and letting everyone know who was boss.  I think everyone on the Wednesday II team knows what an adult Peregrine looks like now.  Very fun.  Many thanks to mister golden sun for showing up today, and to Nick for showing up with the bag of Halloween candy.<br/>

<p>The day started out beautiful!  Our team got up to the hill early, so we did some counting off record, and got 5 species in 15 minutes, including a beautiful look at a juvenile Osprey.  Unfortunately, that pace didn't keep up throughout the day, although we managed to get a countable juvenile Osprey at the end of the day!  We had some fun views of male American Kestrels hunting insects, as well as a Peregrine diving on other birds, including a juvenile Red-shoulder.  All in all, not a bad day.<br/>

<p>THE PIZZA BIRD HAS ARRIVED!  <br/><br/>It was a hot, still, slow day on the hill. Not necessarily the kind of day on which you would to expect to see anything out of the ordinary. But lo and behold, an oddly colorful low-soaring Buteo was spotted in Kirby Cove in the first half hour. It was an adult Ferruginous Hawk with red and white all over. We were flying pretty high on that sighting for the rest of the morning, but the hot hot heat and the slow trickle of birds seemed to be getting everyone's spirits down by the afternoon. Finally we started to see some flurries of Red-tails come through.  Then there was a dark morph RT that didn't look quite right. It was another Ferrug!  My oh my how we all celebrated. But wait, another dark bird had arrived during the commotion. It was all the way on the other side of the north quadrant. We thought it must be the same Ferrug, but how had it ended up over there and now the wing tips are different and what are those....... CARPAL PATCHES!<br/><br/>I guess a week of waiting and hoping has finally paid off.<br/>We are gratified.<br/><br/><br/>

<p>Today was a Red-tailed Hawk day. We saw a fabulous variety of plumages in our many adult and juvenile RTs.  Some so light they lacked a belly-band and some so chocolate that we couldn't see their patagials. Add to that my personal favorites, the intermediate morphs. Anywho, 'twas a good day even though the hawks quit an hour early on us (they didn't get the Daylight Savings Time heads up). Got a little sunburned too. November eh? This is my kind of month.<br/><br/><br/>ERRATA:<br/><br/>I have been politely informed that an error was made in the "Thursday, Oct. 29th" blog posting.  The Northern Goshawk was first spotted in the East Quadrant, not in the West Quadrant as was written. There it stayed for the duration of the sighting. I apologize for any personal injury I may have caused by publishing false facts; I will certainly keep my compass with me from now on.<br/>

<p>Today was filled with some unforgettable sights--an irascible female peregrine (likely the resident) driving off a juvie after a long tussle and then taking potshots at everything from TVs to Redtails; a juv sharpie battling it out with a male kes over telephone pole landing rights between south and east quadrants; a blazing white juv ferrug that lazily wound around and over Hawk Hill only to abort its crossing mid-channel and come back for another beautiful flyby, all the while being divebombed by Redtails; a Hulk Hogan lookalike (mustache and all) dragged up as Heidi posing for photos with passersby on Conzelman--quite the diversity of species!  I hope some of those photos turn out...<br/>

<p>If someone had asked you yesterday how many Accipiter species GGRO Hawkwatchers had seen on the hill this season, you would have answered "two."  However, if someone asked you that same question today (or any day hereafter) you would have to say "THREE!"  West quadrant pointed out a red-shoulder sized accipiter shortly after eleven.  With the help of everyone else's eyes we were able to classify it as a juvenile goshawk.  That's right, we saw a Northern Goshawk--the king of Accipiters.  Albeit the bird was pretty far out so the looks weren't as good as they could have been, but it was still a most momentous moment.<br/>

But luckily it abated as the day went on, leaving us to deal with gusts of a mere 17 mph toward the end.  We had several interesting sightings, including an adult Golden Eagle and a few Peregrines and White-tailed Kites.  A very cold, but satisfied team.<br/>

<p>What a windy day!  Scopes were flying, chairs were tipping over, and Hawkwatchers were bundled up like Penguin watchers.  We had hundreds of Band-tailed Pigeons flying in doughnuts and helices.  There was a Peregrine Falcon trying to clear the skies of the whole Headlands, diving on Red-tails, Ravens, Turkey Vultures, and Accipiters.  Four Golden Eagles soared over Hawk Hill (fortunately all those layers we were wearing provided a bit of cushioning for our necks).  At the very end of the day, we had a distant but identifiable Short-eared Owl.<br/>

We were treated to a great view of a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk who let us take a nice long look as it leisurely made its way to San Francisco.  We also had a juvenile Peregrine - very dark in color - come by and treat us to a nice show for a bit.  Otherwise, we had quite the day of Red-tails, reaching nearly 200 counted!

<p>The day started out slow, except for the juvenile Peregrine we spotted as soon as we started.  It picked up a bit, as did the heat, with lots of Red-tails and a fair number of Sharpies.  The highlight of the day was a leucistic adult Red-tailed Hawk that we spotted far out before it came in closer and flew over Slaker Blind.  The bird actually sparked a lively discussion as to the definitions of partially albino, partially leucistic, and incomplete albinism.  Currently the team is still debating as I type.  All in all, the weather was nice for our second day of Raptor Fest!<br/>

<p>Today was long-awaited for Wednesday IIs Team.  After a string of depressing fog outs, we enjoyed our first full day on the hill this season!  We went up in full fog, determined to blast it away with our own sheer will.  And it worked!  By 11:00 it was clear for miles around.  <br/><br/>The birds were also fashionably late.  We started to see Merlins, and Red-shoulders and Harriers (oh my!).  We also saw two parallel Vs of flying geese.  In one of these Vs  there flew a lone Band-tailed Pigeon doing its best to stay in formation.  <br/><br/>By the end of it all we had that good old satisfied feeling of having completed a full days workfinally.<br/>

<p>Una mas rain out. We stood on the hill amid sporadic showers but were not rewarded this time with the oodles of raptors we wished we would see. We eventually decided that the birds must not be in the mood to fly today. We retreated to sunny Fort Cronkhite. There we witnessed a beautiful adult male Northern Harrier hunting over the hills behind 1064. He was promptly mobbed by a raven and they both disappeared behind a hill. We all had a smile on our faces after the sighting. <br/>'Twas a good way to end the day and perhaps a good omen for Tuesday. Go Hawks Go!  <br/><br/><br/>

<p>The day began promising with some fog, but signs of clearing.  Good visibility and lots of hawks from ten thru noon.  Then, the fog monster came back with a vengeance.  Howling winds and tons of the gray stuff.  You know it's bad when Steve and Tim leave!  We gave up at one and shuffled off the the Hill to contemplate this affront to humanity.<br/><br/>Hope your day was better!<br/><br/>

<p>14 SPECIES!!!!  Including both eagles!  Our adult golden and juvie bald were especially kind, consenting to flybys of Hawk Hill and giving us all great looks.  The Bald Eagle even passed right over a kids group being introduced to raptors--a pretty good introduction, if you ask me.<br/><br/>And to make matters even better, the weather was great!  A little hot to start out, but the breeze picked up a bit within the hour and kept the temp in the 70s all day.  Not much more that you can ask for--great weather and great birds.<br/>

<p>Our brave team went up the hill first thing this morning and held an organized, 4-quadrant count for a two full hours.  We stood in the rain and fog and saw but one bird of prey.  We, along with our Hawkwatch director, decided to scrap the count due to low visibility and bad weather.  And so we spent the rest of the afternoon all cozied up in 1064, talking about raptors.  Not too shabby.  Better luck to tomorrow's crew.<br/>

<p>Today was better than yesterday in terms of number of raptors, but it was still a slow and chilly Hawkwatch.  The strangest part of it was that everyone wanted to get to North quadrant to warm up!  South quadrant was actually the coldest area today, with the wind coming in gusts from the south, increasing as the day went on. <br/><br/>We did have a few good sightings - one early in the day with an adult Peregrine chasing a flock of pigeons, only to get chased out of the area by another adult Peregrine!  Other notable events were the late Osprey sighting, and another adult Peregrine chasing off a juvenile Red-tail.<br/>

<p>Today was a bitterly cold day, with the cloud cover a bit higher than yesterday, but luckily almost no winds.  We had few birds - only 83 total - but quite a few species for such a low count.  11 species seen, including a White-tailed Kite and a couple Merlins.  One of the highlights of the day was spotting the dark morph adult Red-tail that was perched on a pole for a while, looking about as cold as we were!  The day ended with bird number dropping again, but that was expected considering the Blue Angels buzzed us several times after 3 o'clock came around. <br/>

<h2><a name='20091010'/>Saturday, October 10, 2009</h2>
<p>Today was certainly a silver lining sort of day.  And I mean that in every sense of the word: we were literally in the silver lining of one cloud or another over the entirety of the day, which in turn led to the metaphoric meaning by keeping the Blue Angels and their would-be viewers out of our hair.  So rather than being inundated with loud visitors and louder planes, we were instead choked by fog and loud winds.<br/><br/>Cloud cover remained greater than 95% all day with visibility falling at the end of the day.  This decrease in visibility corresponded with an increase in wind speed, which was approximately 25mph on the North Platform before we called it quits for the day.  I never knew silver linings were so darn cold...<br/><br/>On the other hand, we got absolutely spectacular looks at a number of Peregrines.  One of them hung out in North for quite a while and then flew pretty close by the hill on its way out.  We also had a good number of Merlins, and again, a couple of them hung out in North.  Those looks salvaged what was otherwise a dishearteningly dismal day.  <br/><br/>(Even the fleet week festivities were lame--there were only six small ships and a very short show by the Blue Angels.  In case you care, the line of ships consisted of one Amphibious Transport Dock [LPD-20, USS Green Bay], one Coast Guard High Endurance Cutter [WHEC-719, USCGC Boutwell], three Canadian coastal defense vessels [MM-703, HMCS Edmonton; MM-705, HMCS Whitehorse; and MM-710, HMCS Brandon], and one fire-fighting ship [designation unknown])<br/>

<p>Today was a great day up on Hawk Hill.  The skies were clear with moderate winds.  The day began with much excitement over sightings of wild felines behind Fort Cronkhite.  We were then treated to an early morning Merlin (Quick, what did Allen tell us about small falcons this morning?!?!) up on Hawk Hill and a banded juvenile Red-tailed Hawk that(unsuccessfully) stooped on a covey of quail 20 meters from West quadrant. Other raptor highlights of the day include two dark-morph adult Broad-winged Hawks and a Peregrine Falcon driving a Red-tailed Hawk from its telephone pole perch.   <br/>

<p>Today started fairly foggy, but not so much so that we couldn't start on time.  Well, that is, "on time" give or take a morning meeting!  There was slow but steady clearing throughout the day, with a gradual warming trend as well--all in all, a pleasant day.<br/><br/>We saw most of the usual suspects today, excepting Osprey.  And excepting Merlin as well until 3:25 when one showed up right overhead!  No one knows for sure how it got there (we're suspecting either teleportation or black magic), but we did see it leave--chased away by a stooping Peregrine!  A great way to end the day.<br/><br/>The other sightings of note were two close encounters with the elusive Grey Ghost.  Both adult male NOHAs showed up in the rifle-range/rocky ridge/Hawk blind area and stuck around for a while, giving us some pretty good looks.  Truly spectacular birds!  <br/>

<p>The fog monster came back to get us today.  Still, this was one of Wednesday II's better days on the hill.  The lil' falcon presentation at the morning meeting perfectly preceded some lovely merlin fly-bys.  In order to make sure they were counted, most of our Accipiters flew between us and the fog wall.  Many were identified without binoculars.  We got some great looks at adult Coops and Sharpies (they are out there!).  <br/><br/>In our one hour of clarity (12:30pm-1:30pm) there flew a huge gaggle of Greater White-fronted Geese.  Counters approximated their number at 122.  We unfortunately had to call the day a bit early due to weather, heading down the hill at around 2:30.  <br/>

<p>Is it possible to have too much good weather?  That is the prevailing theory as to why the bird count dropped off today--no fog means no backup of hawks which means no super day.  The species count also dropped--no Broadwings for the first time in over a week and no eagles either.<br/><br/>In this case, though, I'm not complaining.  The weather was excellent today, making for a very pleasant day on the hill.  Though we didn't see a huge number of birds, the flow was steady and we didn't get too bored.  And at any rate, it was probably good that things weren't too crazy, as we only had 5 people on the Tuesday II team! <br/><br/>Fortunately we received invaluable help from Tim, Steve, Nick, Harv, and Corinne, allowing us to keep everything covered.  With their help, our team picked up seven Merlins, a couple of which gave us close fly-bys.  Good stuff.<br/>

<p>Due to a broken foot and an attack of the cold we had a bare bones team today.  The four of us met at 1064 and headed up to the hill at 9:15 to get our sunny day started.  After a while our support began to show up.  We gained three more teammates and then the regulars waltzed up the hill.  Then two Hawkwatchers from other teams came and helped us out.  And then we were 9!  That was about the time we saw our FIRST GOLDEN EAGLE OF THE SEASON.  In the next hour we saw our SECOND GOLDEN EAGLE OF THE SEASON!  The birds were almost certainly different individuals since one had noticeably more white on its dorsal wing than the other (both were juveniles).  We had a lot of high birds in the afternoon, dropping down into the 5th quadrant from above. Still plenty of Accipiter ID practice to be had.  Thanks for a great count day Monday II Team!  <br/>

<h2><a name='20091002'/>Friday, October 02, 2009</h2>
<p>Hawkwatching today gave me a distinct feeling of deja vu--I could have sworn that YESTERDAY was the 13 species day with 420ish sightings and a Bald Eagle.  Well, crazily enough, so was today!  <br/><br/>Our Bald Eagle sighting was particularly memorable, because we (that is, Steve) came across it while following a Prairie Falcon.  That's right, a Prairie and a Bald in the same field of view!  Pretty crazy, that's for sure.  And then for good measure, the juvie Bald circled down in Kirby Cove for over 5 minutes, giving us absolutely stunning looks.  <br/><br/>Those sightings, coupled with a few PEFAs, Merlins, and Osprey, brought us up to 12 species.  We sat there for a couple of hours, our bright hopes for tying the species count slowly dimming.  Then, at 3:15, a miracle!  Herb spotted a female Kes, bringing us up to that (currently) hallowed number.  And just for good measure, two more came over just before 3:30.  Apparently the kestrels heard and heeded our pleas, unlike their traitorous brethren (White-tailed Kite, Ferrug, Swanie, Golden, Gos, Rough-leg, Caracara, etc).  Perhaps tomorrow?<br/><br/>But given the very similar nature of the past four days, I think we should just call off the hawkwatch tomorrow and say there were 422ish sightings of 12 species for a total of 71 HpH.  (That is, unless there's fog, which given Saturday I's luck is a distinct possibility.  I'm pulling for the 12 species day, though.)  These 12 species will probably include an eagle.  I'm gonna go out on a limb and say Golden, because another Bald would just be too weird. <br/>

<p>The Power of Positive Thinking: lessons to live by<br/><br/>Positive attitudes yield positive results.  Nowhere is this statement more applicable than with hawkwatching. Thursday I Hawkwatch Team arrived with smiles and enthusiastic greetings. Such optimism has already led to their owning of the season high raptor count and today caused them to tie the season high species count. Crowning the day were the Bald Eagle and Swainie sightings just after noon. <br/><br/>The team enjoyed a warm (but not hot) morning and afternoon with excellent visibility; this was clearly caused by their sunny dispositions.  Powered by delicious corn chowder, the hawkwatchers spotted and passed speck birds with ease.  Truly, it was an honor to witness the power of positive thinking in action. Go team.

Immediately on cresting the hill, we witnessed a series of aerial dogfights between a congress of ravens and a cast of Red-tails (those are the appropriate terms for groups of the above birds).  The raptors dwindled in the afternoon and Accipiter identification was made even more complicated by the effect of high winds on flight attitude and shape.       <br/>

<p>We started the day with great hopes: the hill was clear, the forecast was good, and yesterday had a very respectable day.  Unfortunately, our hopes (and hawk count) followed the wind speed (quite low) instead of the temperature (not quite so low).  The wind picked up about five hours too late (around 3:00), resulting in a sweaty day with not all that many birds.<br/><br/>On the plus side, we did see 24 Broadwings and some really fast-flying Merlins.  Our "tweet sheet" also had a good day, perhaps because there weren't that many hawks around!  We saw hundreds of Vaux's Swifts and were buzzed by a flock of 25ish Black Swifts.  So that was sure cool, though more raptors would have been nice.  Maybe tomorrow.  (But bring lots of water just in case.)<br/>

<p>Once again the Friday II Hawkwatch team lucked out. Although the day started with thick fog, we were able to get up on the hill after a leisurely morning meeting.  It heated up quite quickly and there was very little air movement, but even so we saw more than 86 hawks per hour.  Highlights included a kettle of 10 Broad-wings and an adult male Northern Harrier.  <br/>

<p>Today we were engulfed by fog and thus unable to conduct the hawkwatch.  Alas, even the annex was socked in, and so we took a nice walk around the lagoon instead.  We saw some nice shorebirds and ducks, and even a couple of raptors.  But the organism we spotted the most of was the "disgruntled hawkwatcher."  (Both the GGRO and independent subspecies were in evidence.)  They shambled about the shore in small to medium disheartened flocks, moving largely without purpose.  Curiously, many individuals appeared ready for sunny weather and good visibility, sporting all manner of optical equipment and sun protection ... adaptations that made little sense given local conditions. Apparently the lagoon is the sub-optimal habitat for this species.<br/><br/>Better luck tomorrow.<br/>

<p>The day started out pretty foggy, so we went on a walk around the lagoon.  Several shorebird sightings, a brief glimpse of a kestrel, and two Red-shouldereds (adult and juvenile) gave us a beautiful show, allowing us to compare the two ages.  <br/><br/>We heard tales of a bit of blue showing, so we headed up to the Annex in anticipation.  Unfortunately, when we got there it was clear that the Hill was still fogged in.  It would briefly appear before disappearing into haze for a while, so we stayed in the Annex.  But we had some lovely finds!  A Broad-winged and an adult Peregrine appeared in the skies at the same time, and the Peregrine gave us quite a show while diving at a dark Red-tail.  However, the Hill did refuse to clear up by 1, so we had to call it a day.<br/>

<p>Today hawkwatch's fog intern (Robyn) and sun intern (Nathan) combined forces to produce a half-foggy day.  Half in the sense that it was clear above and foggy below--an "A" in the lingo of the GGRO.  After the day ended, we decided that the sun was ascendant today because Robyn was tired.  (Though wouldn't sleep deprivation make everything a little more foggy?  Make it seem all hazy?)<br/><br/>Regardless, we had a great day on the hill, seeing 13 species of raptor!  We had a four falcon day accented by a good number of Red-shoulders, a Broadwing, and two kites.  Perhaps this will win the diversity competition?  We'll see....  <br/>

<p>This morning we took a bird walk around the lagoon until we got word the fog was lifting.  We had fog below us for most of the day by the sky cleared enough for us to see 360 degrees until about 2pm. We had a lovely visit from five Broad-winged Hawks today.  Only one was a juvenile.  They were very obliging and circled around the golden gate for the better part of an hour.  Isn't it great when they do that?  We saw more adult Red-tailed Hawks than juveniles today.  Also a good showing for Red-shoulders.  Good luck tomorrow Tuesday II team!  We wish you a full day of sunny skies and hawk bellies.<br/><br/><br/>

<p>This morning the skies were filled with fog. But luckily for us our morning meeting was timed perfectly.  By the time we got up to the annex, Hawk Hill began to clear.  When we crested the platform at 10am it was blue sky and sunshine all over.  Raptors flew by in a steady flow.  We found a Broad-winged Hawk in a kettle of Red-tails and Turkey Vultures.  What appeared to be the same juvenile Broad-wing hung out in the headlands for a while, visiting most of the quadrants by the end of the day.  There were also a few kettle of accipiters, in which Sharp-shinned hawks always outnumbered the Cooper's Hawks.  At around 3pm the fog decided to come back in and spoil our party.  We hung on until 3:30.<br/>

<p>Today was truly a smoking day on the hill.  And I mean that both figuratively and literally.  We scrambled up the hill filled with anticipation as visions of yesterday's count (690) danced in our heads.  And indeed the day started out well, with good numbers of accips and red-tails.  We also had a fair number of red-shoulders, a couple of them beautiful adult birds in all their glory.<br/><br/>But just as we were sure that the curse of Friday I had finally been lifted, disaster struck!  Visitors and hawkwatchers alike spotted a small fog-like cloud forming far down below Conzelman Road, to the west of Kirby Cove.  At first, we suspected little.  But as time went on, the harmless little cloud grew and grew, turning into an ominous pillar of smoke reaching up to engulf the Golden Gate.<br/><br/>Binoculars and scopes revealed orange flames at the base, and so we alerted 1064, and Jill in turn called the fire department.  Soon after, sirens began winding their way up Conzelman and a Coast Guard helicopter appeared to circle the expanding plume.  Though the fire was small, it was inaccessible to land-based personnel, and so backup was summoned in the form of aircraft and a Coast Guard vessel.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, this required us to leave the hill--airborne fire-suppressant is not always the most accurate and the park service didn't want us anywhere near the area.  So much to our dismay, we were chivvied down the hill and told to leave the area via the one-way road.  Though the fire was mostly out by 2pm, the road was still closed, and thus we called it a day.  The day certainly didn't lack excitement, though we would have hoped for a few more hours on the hill!<br/>

<p>Today it happened.  We wished the morning fog away and it worked!  And then the hawks came.  They came by the hundreds.   And we, the Thursday I Hawkwatch team, were ready.  Accipiter after Accipiter identified with grace and relative ease (at least the ones that weren't undoc or unidentified).  Each quadrant's birds were passed with consummate skill.  It was beautiful, a well orchestrated ballet.  <br/><br/>Here are some of the highlights:<br/><br/>The sharpie season high was quadrupled. Merlins are starting to come through by the more than ones.  We were getting kettles of ten or so birds with two to four species each.  <br/><br/>Special thanks to the bringers of the soup, pumpkin bread, zucchini bread, watermelon slices, and falcon fudge.<br/>

After half an hour we were still fogged in so we packed up our scopes and headed down the hill.<br/>

It backed off a little, but came back in again before we called it a day.

<h2><a name='20090912'/>Saturday, September 12, 2009</h2>
<p>Today we were weathered out.  I say "weathered out" rather than "fogged out" because dense, ground-level fog was only one of the many impediments to hawkwatch today--there was also a very low cloud ceiling, rain, lightning, and even a little bit of hail!  It seems that the fog got together with all of its buddies and conspired to keep us not only off of the hill, but cooped up in 1064.<br/>
<br/>
We still had a good time, though.  Some get-to-know you stuff at the beginning, which was quite helpful for those of us new to the team.  I then did my level best to impersonate Allen in the morning meeting by dragging out the accipiter education module as long as I could.  Alas, I don't think I remembered all of his tangents.  Too bad--they would have come in handy today!<br/>
<br/>
When I finally ran out of steam, the hawkwatchers departed for some hiking while I worked on switching the display case to peak birds (huzzah!).  Their quick return (prompted by the aforementioned precipitation) forced a showing of Raptor Force, which basically compares military planes to birds of prey.  What it lacked in real educational value it certainly made up for in cool footage of birds and planes doing crazy acrobatics and flying really fast!  Which, incidentally, will be ours to experience first-hand in just a couple of weeks--I'm sure y'all are looking forward to that!<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, here's hoping for some clear days with moderate winds and many birds.<br/>

In addition to close flybys by a number of Kestrels, we were also treated to the sight of one of the bridge Peregrines (presumably) defending its territory against an encroaching Prairie. The aerial acrobatics were quite spectacular, though unfortunately distant over Slacker Ridge. Other than that, lots of Red-tails and a good number of Coops.

I emerged from the NPS dorm this morning amazed and dismayed &mdash; it was cold and foggy with Hawk Hill completely obscured!  So after an enlightening morning lesson, we dispirited hawkwatchers birded around the lagoon.  Don't get me wrong&mdash;we did see some interesting stuff, but they weren't our beloved raptors. <br />
 <br />
But around noon, a miracle!  The fog began to lift with such speed that we were still on our way back to 1064 when Hawk Hill completely cleared.  After grabbing our gear and throwing it (and ourselves) into vehicles, we raced up to the top.  To be surrounded by fog.  Completely (maximum visibility of &lt;1 mile).  Dismay, made even more vicious by the knowledge that somewhere above Slacker, a Golden Eagle waited (reported by other GGRO volunteers).  By the time the fog cleared (clearing being a relative term), the eagle was, alas, gone.  Instead we had to make do with a less sought-after season first&mdash;20+ mph winds!  Gotta love shaking scopes and binoculars... <br />
 <br />
However, these winds did clear out the fog, and by 2, Mt. Diablo was intermittently visible.  We saw a fair number of hawks, and were delighted by three juvenile coops that hung out right above us for several minutes.  At any rate, a much better day than we had anticipated! <br />

An absolutely gorgeous day on the hill&mdash;the temperature was mostly pleasant, and the breeze was strong enough to be quite refreshing. Great visibility too&mdash;all the way to the geysers beyond the North Saddle (66 miles away). So the landscapes were great, but unfortunately not well populated with raptors: only had double digits of turkey vultures and red-tails. However, we did see nine kestrels, getting a number of good looks. And as mentioned earlier, the weather was absolutely amazing. So being up there was by no means trying! An excellent way to spend the day. <br />

The day started out beautiful, with no fog. It got a little hot, reaching the low 90s, but Allen eventually made it to the Hill with an extra five gallons of water for us! The day seemed fairly slow, but we got a few good sightings of Osprey coming in close, and had a couple Red-shoulders at one point giving us a beautiful view of their striking colors. <br />

Today was the first pleasant balmy day up on Hawk Hill. We beat the previous high hawk sighting day of the season. Red-tailed hawks even out-numbered Turkey Vultures! The best sighting of all was the first Prairie Falcon recorded this season.<br />

Things looked pretty foggy at the beginning of the day, but we were able to get up on the Hill around 11:30. At that point it was still pretty foggy, but we saw an adult Red-shouldered Hawk pretty soon after getting set up! For the next few hours the fog was in and out, but around 2:30 it started getting pretty clear. The most exciting part of the day was when the fog cleared, allowing the helicopter to finally start doing its job. We got to watch as it flew one of the power towers down to just beside the stables. We watched it avidly to make sure no hawks were in the way (and to see if it dropped the tower), and luckily no raptors were in sight.  <br />

Despite high hopes of no fog, today was completely fogged out. We made it out to the Annex for about an hour and a half, surrounded by mostly white. Most of the time we couldn't even see the Golden Gate Bridge, and we once caught one brief glimpse of a very white-looking Hawk Hill. We managed to see a few Red-tails and Turkey Vultures through the fog, and one Osprey came flying right overhead, but that was it for the day, unfortunately. <br />

Another scorcher today, but not quite as hot as it was yesterday, for which we were most thankful! Unfortunately, the air was relatively still all day, resulting in few raptors. But not a bad day to be on the hill, especially since we had plenty of ice-cold water in the GGRO cooler. <br />

All in all a very HOT, still, slow day on the hill, but we count ourselves fortunate to have made it up for a full six hours of hawk watching. We saw 110 birds of six species, including one beautiful dark morph adult red-tail, three male American Kestrels, three female American Kestrels and one red-shouldered hawk. We hit 95.5 degrees, so don.t forget water, hat and sunscreen when you come out to join us! <br />

Our very first fog-free day!  Well, not entirely fog-free, but we did get up onto the hill promptly at 9:30 for the first time this season.  And what a day it was!  We saw TEN species today, getting to the double digits in species much earlier than the past two years.  We were sitting happy with eight species at 3pm (a few early ospreys, a bunch of red-shoulders mid-day, some female kestrels in the afternoon, a smattering of standard accipiters, and lots of TVs and red-tails) and getting ready to call it a good day when a white-tailed kite booked it down in front of Slacker Ridge and we saw two peregrines&mdash;one on the bridge, one popping up far out over Wolfback Ridge.<br />
<br />
The afternoon was a lot slower bird-wise: as temperatures rose, the hawks settled down.  It was quite warm by the time we quit (89 degrees Fahrenheit), so bring lots of water if you come up to visit or count!  But all in all, a beautiful day to be on the hill.<br />

Weather on the hill was windy and foggy today, but we managed to count hawks from 12:30 until 3pm. The high point of the day was watching two Kestrels for about five minutes until they shot over our heads and sped off into the south Quadrant. Only three species seen today - Turkey Vultures, Redtails, and Kestrels. <br />

The day started out foggy, but looked like it might clear up soon, so after a morning meeting we headed up to the Hill.  We arrived in fog, but walked up all the same, only to face more fog.  It occasionally started to clear, but seemed to always end up foggier than before.  Tired of the fog, we headed to the Annex to see some birds – mostly a few Red-tails and Turkey Vultures, although we had one Peregrine sighting!  Eventually we did have to conclude that the fog was not going to lift, and ended our day around 1 pm.<br />

The  Monday 2 Hawkwatch team braved the fog and wind this morning in order to  squeeze in an hour and 45 minutes of observation. Unfortunately they were forced to come down  early due to fog-out at 1 pm. What did  they report as their most exciting moment? A banana slug on the road up to Hawk  Hill! Understandably they then had to  relocate said slug to the vegetation off of the road. The slug was first sighted by Suzanne, a UCSC  alum. Coincidence? I think not. <br />

Hooray! Though the morning began in a foggy way, the  clouds eventually parted over Hawk Hill and we were able to Hawkwatch from  11:30am -3:30pm today. Maximum  visibility hung at around 2 miles for the duration of our stay. We bundled up and hunkered down for a slow  but exciting early-season view of the flyway.  A juvenile Northern Harrier and Cooper's Hawks was probably the best  looks of the day. But try as we may, our  other raptor-ing successes could best be described as okay (as the numbers  below will display). But hey, we love  being out in the headlands anyway! Yay.<br />

Fogged out again.  Bummer.  It was too foggy to see anything from the Annex so we went down to the lagoon.  Our day leader put us through Scoping 101 and simulated a hawkwatch so that the apprentices could familiarize themselves with the data sheet.  We saw turkey vultures, red-tails, an osprey, a male kestrel, and an adult red-shoulder.<br />

                    FIRST DAY ON THE HILL! FIRST DAY ON THE HILL!  YAY! When we arrived for our morning meeting today we were pleased to see that the fog had finally lifted and Hawk Hill was visible.  While it was overcast with NW winds for most of the day we did see some sunshine in the afternoon.  In our full 5 1/2 hour day we managed to count 189 raptors.  That amounted to 33.82 hawks/hr.  Our most exciting sightings included, but were not limited to: a triple fly-by of an adult peregrine falcon, 2 dark morph juvie red-tails, 2 Ospreys, and a strafing by a female kestrel on a mission.  We hope tomorrow's crew will be blessed with good weather and see many, many raptors. <br />

           Fogwatch only for the first day of the season. The team was unable to go up and count hawks due to heavy fog. Better luck to the Tuesday 1crew!<br/>
