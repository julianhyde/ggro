<p>The count team today was rewarded with great weather and plenty of raptors.  In our first hour, an adult Bald gave us a nice look before crossing the Gate toward the old Letterman Hospital. Redtails kept counters busy with kettles forming throughout the day.  A Roughleg appeared over the Tam ridge in the 1 pm hour.<br/><br/>Late in the day a Broad-winged Hawk was seen above Wolf Ridge followed by a Ferruginous flying low over the bay, east of the GG Bridge.  Adding in a Redshoulder, we enjoyed a five buteo day. Seven Peregrines also.<br/><br/>- Sam Hontalas (DL)<br/><br/>Brian O'Laughlin (DL), Mary Malec, Lisa Michl, Jeff Boissier.<br/>

<p>Things started grim with sticky fog at the hilltop but we had visibility downslope from the start. The fog cleared, the skies brightened, and the hawks started to fly.  FIVE BUTEO DAY with two Roughlegs at the same time - a juv that circled Hawk Hill and headed south, and an adult female that bee-lined for Hawk Blind.<br/><br/>Also had a good look at a juvenile Broad-winged Hawk that backtracked to join a kettle at Hill 88 and then headed south with Redtails. Speaking of Redtails, many kettles in the west and north - some up to 12 birds strong.  Rounded out our Buteo day with a Ferrug in the NE skies.<br/><br/>Also had good looks at PEFA's a handsome male Kestrel, a smattering of accipiters and a harrier.  Kudos to the tam today for working hard thru the low visibility and then refocusing on high-flying and faraway hawks. Until next year...<br/><br/>- Mary Kenney (DL)<br/><br/>Dennis Davison (DL), Tom Luster, Pat Bacchetti, Catherine Eliot<br/><br/><br/>

<p>An unforgettable season for this Monday 2 team concluded with a day when the only memorable moments were between friends.  There was one was intriguing juv Redtail with highly contrast back and white feathers, instead of the more typical tawny-browns, but otherwise the skies were relatively empty.  A huge blimp flew around the Golden Gate and there were some interesting cloud formations but raptors?

<p>Not too many raptors as we braved 16 mph gusts.  A few Sharpshins, Harriers, and mostly Redtails. A late Osprey.  Best bird was a nice late season Prairie Falcon. Great overhead looks.<br/><br/>We did enjoy a surprise marriage proposal complete with champagne and five-piece mariachi band that played for an hour right next to the fence.

<p>The Saturday 1 team finished their season in grand fashion - a 5 buteo species day! Late in the first hour a Ferruginous Hawk appeared at Hill 88 and made its way across the Golden Gate. In the noon hour a very late adult broadwing was spotted in Kirby Cove bringing much excitement to the team and visitors as well. If that wasn't enough, about 90 minutes later an adult light morph Swainson's Hawk materialized high over North Slacker. Two redshoulders and 84 redtails including a few dark morphs capped off a wild buteo count. <br/><br/>What a beautiful day on the hill. Warm weather, warmer company and a great count day. Many thanks to Saturday 1 for enduring fog and cold early in the season, but working hard together to produce a few exciting days when the weather cooperated.<br/><br/>-Sam Hontalas (DL)<br/><br/>Jane Rudebusch (DL), Andy Bradshaw, Jennifer Miller, Rod Santos, Melissa Hero<br/>

<p>Excessively hot for November - whew! Kind of a slow-ish day, punctuated by kettles of redtails and fly-bys of interested birds. The total redtail count was 153, with one being a confusing one to age - very clear wing windows and juvenile body plumage plus a fully red tail. Thanks to George Eade for getting a photo that shed some light on the ID. With four minutes left in this team's whole season, Tomas spotted a lovely juvenile Ferruginous Hawk over Angel Island. It was an excellent way to close out the season for this team. Thank you to the whole team for a good season; see you next year!<br/><br/>-Linda Schneider (DL)<br/><br/>Libby Rouan (DL), Roy Pisetsky, Bob Blumberg, Maggie Montenegro, Tomas McKay<br/>

The 68 raptors counted included one male harrier, two Merlins, and a late in the day dark morph redtail.

<p>As it is Halloween, it seemed appropriate that the Ravens ruled the sky over Hawk Hill today.  And what a sky - grays, whites, and cloudy; shimmering sunlight moved across the sky making for gorgeous landscapes. Raptors? Not so much. A few accipiters, Redtails, and TVs. Two very distant Ferruginous Hawks, one Peregrine. Typical for a pre-storm day dominated by south and southwest winds. Still a lovely day.<br/><br/>- Becky Olsen (DL)<br/>Ken Wilson (DL), Carol Weinstein, Patrick Coughlin, Laura Coatney, Melissa Kohner<br/>

<p>A beautiful day on the Hill with a good flow of birds throughout. There was very little wind but oddly many birds were popping up from the Southwest and flying in close, especially the sharpies. There were also many kettles forming towards the end of the day with a good mix of redtails, accipiters, and vultures. We had great close-in looks at an Osprey and overhead looks of a molt-y Swainson's hawk. The team was very excited when Bob spotted a juvenile golden eagle in the North quadrant by the FM towers. It didn't fly in close but the team still got a good look at the white at the base of the tail. Overall, a very fun day to be out counting!<br/><br/>-Ashley Santiago<br/>Roy Pisetsky, Robert Blumberg, Margarita Montenegro, Tomas McKay<br/>

<p>A somewhat slow but steady count. The wind died down a few times leaving us bereft of raptors. But the mix of Redtails, and accips, adult and juvs, was pretty great.

<p>A beautiful day on Hawk Hill.  The flow of accipiters is waning but we were compensated with spectacular views of Peregrines and harriers. A pair of adult Peregrines circled above Hawk Hill a number of times, sometimes vocalizing, and apparently engaging in an aerial dance.  <br/><br/>Not to be outdone, a beautiful adult male Northern Harrier flew close by for all to see, and a bit later, a bright orange juvenile.

The Merlins were especially fun, with regularly spaced appearances throughout the day, including one individual who was dipped in black ink, likely originating from the PAC NW coast.  <br/><br/>Fleet week crowds not as bad as in the past, with not more than 100 people on the top of Hawk Hill at any one time.

<p>Another tough Tuesday - fog was ever-present and a fierce chilly west wind persisted all day.  No big numbers but most of the usual suspects.  As if they knew it was the month of Halloween, out of the spooky fog came a Gray Ghost, a nice bird toward the end of the day. Skies cleared at 3:01 pm!<br/><br/>PS (Allen Fish) - This morning there were still smoky hotspots on Hawk Hill from the wildfire that started about 430 pm yesterday, and was controlled last night. County and NPS fire crews spent the AM working on complete dousing through the middle of the day. In all, less than 1 acre was burned, near the western access trail to the summit. Great thanks to our awesome fire crews.<br/><br/>- Mary Kenney (DL)<br/><br/>Dennis Davison (DL), Tom Luster, Catherine Elliott, Pat Bacchetti<br/><br/>

<p>A wonderful day on Hawk Hill. We identified 12 raptor species and a plethora of Sharpshins. High points of the day were juv Ferrug and WT Kite.  We were gifted with a cool western breeze and an extremely compressed fogbank making our duties that much more enjoyable.  Temps hovered around 70 deg all day.<br/><br/>PS - about 430 pm, an hour after the hawkwatch closed down, a grassland-scrub fire started on the west flank of Hawk Hill near the west-face access trail, above the elevation of the parking lot but on the opposite side of the Hill. Emergency vehicles came up Conzelman Road rapidly, and exact status is not clear as of 610 pm due to thick fog.<br/><br/>- James McDermott (DL)/Allen Fish<br/><br/>Deborah Crooks (DL), Rich Eliason, George Eade, Linda Chambers, Paulette Yeckley<br/>

<p>A fantastic Sunday on Hawk Hill.  Though a bit hot for awhile, peaking around 2 pm at 86-deg, the raptors kept us going.  Highlights included Broadwings, 4 Ferrug, a juv Light Swainsons, and a juv Golden.  Of course we can't forget Coops, Sharpies, RT's and Shoulders.  1 lonely Kestrel.  Non-raptor highlight was a Bobcat mom with two kittens frolicking below Kremins Crag.

<p>We had an all day inversion layer of fog and light winds from the Northeast kept conditions comfortable for the most part and visibility was excellent throughout the day. Saturday 1's first full day of counting was a busy one indeed. Accipiter numbers were strong with a total of 191 including four adults (1 coop and 3 sharpies) A handful of Broadwings provided excitement as well. 380 raptors were counted overall. <br/><br/>But the highlight of the day was a beautiful juvenile Golden Eagle which gave us great close overhead looks. First of the season for this species.<br/><br/>A last minute large kettle high over Slacker Saddle produced another Broadwing and a Swainson's Hawk!

<p>Beautiful day starting with a light wind from the east.  After an hour or so it shifted to west for the rest of the day, maxing at about 6 mph.  Birds started slow, and slowly picked up. Nearly all raptors came in at North Saddle and followed the ridge south past Slacker Hill to the Gate. <br/><br/>Only 19 Sharpshins and 25 Coops. Has the accipiter floodgate been slammed shut? Time will tell.  Late in the day a beautiful male Harrier gave us a 20- minute show crossing back and forth along Rocky Ridge, finally leaving toward the Golden Gate. Not ONE Broadwing!

<p>"The fog giveth and the fog taketh away." - J. Altemus<br/><br/>Even through we were surrounded by fog, we were able to start the count on time.  Sadly by 1230 we were fogged out. But before the fog shut us down, we were inundated with juvenile Sharpshins - far away, midrange, and right in our faces. One otherwise stable hawkwatcher was sure that a Sharpshin was coming in for an attack.  We saw a decent number of Broad-winged Hawks, mostly in Kirby Cove and out near the Bridge.

The team waited it out until 1pm and the rain did stop, but the fog only got foggier. It was clear that it was not going to clear this afternoon so the team called it a day.

<p>Was that rain falling this morning in the Marin Headlands, or simply dense sea-mist?  One can never be sure out here in fogland. Today's hawkwatch was eclipsed by whatever that moisture was sitting low on the hilltops, including on Hawk Hill, with no real change throughout the day.<br/><br/>The hawkwatch team enjoyed some trail birding in Rodeo Valley and at Rodeo Lagoon, and even found some raptors among the willows and grasslands: Red-tailed Hawk, TV's, harriers and accipiters.  And Red-necked Phalaropes on the lagoon, which by themselves are worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>- Cheryl Lentini (DL)/Allen Fish<br/><br/>Don Bartling (DL), Maureen Grabowski, Susan Greef, Linda Sudduth, Rich Cimino<br/>

<h2><a name='20210913'/>Monday, September 13, 2021</h2>
<p>An epic day.  16 species of diurnal raptors, 423 sightings. 94 raptors per hour. Seven Osprey. There were raptors flying from end to end of today even starting with a partially fogged day on Hawk Hill.  The wind picked up in the mid-day, and the variety of raptors matched it with a notable number of unique pairings:<br/><br/> Prairie Falcon flying wingtip to wingtip with a dark juv Peregrine<br/><br/> Two juv Northern Harriers escorting an adult Osprey around the west shoulder of Hawk Hill<br/><br/> A juvenile Bald and a juv Swainson's meet up by mistake in the South Quadrant, and must do-si-do to avoid each other<br/><br/> Two juv Redtails disappear into the fog, and appear fifty feet away as two juv Redshoulders, then the Tails reappear after the Shoulders head southeast for the GG Bridge<br/><br/>And a few "first-of-season" species today on Hawk Hill - Bald Eagle, Broad-winged Hawk, Ferruginous Hawk - all juvs, added to the wonder of the day.<br/><br/>Did we mention 7 Osprey?<br/><br/>Great thanks to this small, hard-working team for their vigilance and focus today.<br/><br/>- Deborah Crooks/Allen Fish (co-DLs)<br/><br/>Team: Christina Cambie, Wade Eakle, George Eade<br/><br/>

<p>The sky stayed blue overhead while the fog stayed below and west of us, and the smoke haze stayed north and east. Dead air in the AM turned to brisk NW wind in the PM.<br/><br/>Highlights were 2 Osprey, 2 Redshoulders, 1 White-tailed Kite, 2 Kes, plus assorted Coops and Sharps. Quick look at a Merlin hustling south, and an adult Peregrine that flew from the west side of Hawk Hill a few hundred feet above the water, then flew and flew and climbed and climbed and flew and climbed, and landed on the upper catwalk of the North Tower of the GG Bridge. It's great to be back on the Hill.<br/><br/>We dedicate this count-day to the memory of our friend and colleague Jim Clausen, Sunday hawkwatcher for more than 20 years...<br/><br/>- Becky Olsen/Allen Fish<br/>Team: Ken Wilson, Laura Coatney, Patrick Coughlin<br/><br/>

<p>Today was ruled by kettles! The fog started out thick, but once it lifted around 11am the team found themselves surrounded by Red-tailed Hawks. At times, we had two kettles in East and another in West. The birdnadoes were mostly made up of groups of about 5-15 birds, mostly a mix of redtails and Turkey Vultures with relatively few accipiters seen. The highlights were some excellent views of an Osprey and Red-shouldered Hawks, including one adult. It was a busy first day of the season for this team of hawkwatchers, but it was an exciting way to jump back in!<br/><br/>-Ashley Santiago<br/>

<p>This team had a mostly foggy day with some clearing that allowed for views of many rambunctious Red-tailed Hawks. Walking up to Hawk Hill we were greeted by two redtails battling it out with a Cooper's Hawk and we knew it would be a decent day for birds. The highlights were seeing a Red-shouldered Hawk, some American Kestrels, and a few Sharp-shinned Hawks zoom overhead. The fog really settled in by the end of the day, slowing down the count, but overall the light fog couldn't stop us from having a great day!<br/>

<p>Overcast skies in the AM turned to fast NW winds (gusts to 21 mph) in the PM.  The gangs of juvenile Redtails were fast and busy today, many hugging Slacker Ridge south to the Golden Gate. Twelve in one binocular view.<br/><br/>A few Coops, no Sharps yet.  Highlight of the day -- a big female Prairie Falcon came ripping into the west flank of Hawk Hill to irritate a young stilling Redtail. The falcon gave us a turn and then zoomed (like the bird not like the webinar) across the Gate to San Francisco. A 2 pm Osprey at eye level was stunning to see so close.
