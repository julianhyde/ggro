<h2><a name='20241201'/>Sunday, December 01, 2024</h2>
<p>This morning, we were greeted by fierce winds, sparse clouds, a pair of floating Peregrine Falcons, a foldable table filled with an array of treats, and smiling faces of hawkwatchers and banders celebrating the last day of the season. In the first half hour of the count, we instinctively watched what first looked like a lanky Red-tailed Hawk zoom in from the East quadrant and shuffle into the North quadrant. After seeing different angles of this bird, and with trained eyes from the crowd, we determined it as a juvenile Swainson’s Hawk! By the afternoon, the wind dialed back, our bellies were full of snacks, and giggles were still echoing throughout the group. In synchrony, we raised our binoculars up to the sky, as we have routinely done since August 12th, and admired the birds zipping over us. We had the good fortune to witness and exchange thoughts on some interesting Red-tailed Hawks. At first glance, one Redtail appeared to be a dark morph juvenile but after further inspection, via photos taken by the amazing hawkwatchers, we believe it could be a Harlan’s subspecies. Another unordinary Red-tailed Hawk first struck our attention with its pale ventral view. As we watched it weave between ravens and dance among the landscape, we noticed an orange tail with a white base. These entrancing Red-tailed Hawks were the perfect way to wrap up the season. Thank you Sunday 2 and all the hawkwatchers for your dedication and passion! Now that the raptors have dispersed, we shall follow. <br/><br/>-Ren Chen <br/><br/>Day leaders: Ken Wilson & Becky Olsen <br/><br/>Count Team: Ana Olivar, Ann Meisinger, Carol Weinstein, Cody Levin, Maggie Montenegro, Rose Fielding, Ren Chen, & company <br/>

<p>The mid 50s temperatures, clear skies, and strong Northeast winds of the previous day persisted this morning. Although the gusts today weren’t quite as ferocious, the stalwart Hawkwatchers stayed bundled in their modern armor to keep warm. Red-tailed Hawks dotted the sky, and the high winds propelled several Cooper’s Hawks and American Kestrels across the hill, seemingly helpless to remain in control against the powerful gusts. Several Peregrine Falcon sightings were highlights of the day, with one coming so close that we could see its yellow cere and giant feet. “Never gets old”, commented Krish. A couple of juvenile Northern Harriers were spotted cruising the hillsides, one of them being divebombed by some unkind Common Ravens. The winds briefly subdued in the early afternoon, before ramping up and blowing harder than ever out of the North during our last hour on the hill. Baked goods and interested visitors helped make the day wholesome, as did the wonderful company.  <br/><br/>Thanks for the great season, Saturday 2!  <br/><br/>-Luke Scott <br/><br/>Dayleader: Jan Ambrosini <br/><br/>Count Team: Jennifer Miller, Tim Stroshane, Maryrose Kulick, Krish Maypole, & Luke Scott <br/>

<p>A pair of Peregrine Falcons flew low over Hawk Hill, piercing the howling Northeast gales as the Hawkwatchers lumbered through the onslaught of wind to begin today’s count. Temperatures in the mid 50s felt much colder due to the relentless strong wind, with gusts over 25mph. The sky was clear, and the falcons took full advantage of the morning air, putting on quite the show for the bundled-up onlookers, before eventually careening South towards Land’s End at unbelievable speeds. A few excellent looks at adult Sharp-shinned Hawks provided us with some mental nourishment after the falcons moved on, and before long, the sky was full of looming Red-tailed Hawks, hanging near-motionless despite the turbulent air currents. Later in the day, the peregrines made another appearance, divebombing a helpless juvenile Northern Harrier over slacker ridge. The wind provided us with the opportunity to witness some interesting, if not chaotic flight patterns today, and the team did their best to stay warm and drink it all in. It was a lovely end of season day for Friday 2. <br/><br/>Thanks for the season, everyone! <br/><br/>-Luke Scott <br/><br/>Dayleader: Libby Rouan <br/><br/>Count Team: Nick Yatsko, Denise Peck, Paulette Sherry, Will Ludan, & Carol Weinstein <br/>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving from the hill! Today I am grateful for resplendent raptors and fantastic friends. We had a picture-perfect day, despite the cold temperatures and the rather slow trickle of birds! In keeping with the theme lately, even though the total number of raptors was low, we still had great diversity with 10 different species sighted! Highlights of the day included a pair of Peregrine Falcons showing off their impressive flight skills, a few male American Kestrels flying close to the hill displaying their jaunty colors, a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk overhead giving everyone a clear view of its stunning plumage, and a dark morph adult Red-tailed Hawk flying with some lighter morph redtails to show us a perfect comparison view.

<p>The week of stormy weather was finally behind us, and today’s team was welcomed to the hill by crystal clear skies and a brisk northeast breeze. The low 50s temperatures and moderate wind persisted throughout the day, and the Hawkwatchers were delighted to observe Peregrine Falcons and American Kestrels cruising along. The late season warm lighting made aging raptors more difficult today. At first glance, the birds were all beautifully orange. We were almost thrown off by some Northern Harriers and Sharp-shinned Hawks but luckily, we had cameras and diligent photographers to get a closer, more detailed perspective. It reminded us that even with cumulative years of hawk-watching experience, raptors are still tricky to identify and require teamwork to do so. <br/><br/>-Luke & Ren <br/><br/>Dayleader: Don Bartling <br/><br/>Count Team: Wing Ng, Courtney Buechert, Patti Lessard, Heller Stanton, Stefanie Arthur, Joan Duffield, Doris Rodriguez, Ren Chen, Luke Scott <br/>

<p>“Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure..... Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself?” <br/><br/>-Herman Melville <br/><br/> <br/><br/>The day began with hope, and fog...so much fog. The haze hugged us like a tattered sweater that has been loved beyond mending. Brief arrows of blue sky pierced the veil of endless clouds offering some hope in the glass-stained landscape, and when hope dwindled, we had baba ghanoush and cookies. Beams of sunlight steadily prevailed, giving way to a sky painted with layers of clouds, rippling across our field of vision, like the waves of a sea in the wake of an offshore storm. With glossy eyes we looked across the depths of the bay, past the towers of the city, into a sky that appeared devoid of raptor life. The Hawkwatchers stayed vigilant, scanning the skies, and remaining steadfast, holding on to some semblance of hope that a late season rarity would grace our presence. In the afternoon we conjured a sprinkling of birds, many of them perched under white translucent sheets that draped incessantly over us. And in these threads were spotted a few straggling raptors, outliers in the great southward movement that was the 2024 Fall migration: American Kestrels, a close Sharp-shinned Hawk, and our familiar Red-tailed Hawks, among them. The Hawkwatchers said their farewells, grasping each other’s hands, before moving down their respective paths. Our seasonal communion was over, but thoughts of next year’s flight were already beginning to form at the fringes of our minds. <br/><br/>Luke, Ren & Rose <br/><br/>Dayleader: Horacia Mena <br/><br/>Count Team: Maureen Grabowski, Dennis Davison, Mary Kenney, Nat Smale, Rose Fielding, Ren Chen, Luke Scott <br/>

<p>Well, we got a solid hour of counting in today before the weather forced us to retreat! Although only 10 raptors were counted, we did have a surprising amount of diversity with 4 species in that wet and foggy hour. We saw Red-tailed Hawks perched close on Fish Rock and stilling above the north quadrant, a lone Turkey Vulture floating by, and a juvenile Northern Harrier being harassed by a determined male American Kestrel. It was a great day eating and bird watching with the Monday 2 crew – thanks for everything this season, team! <br/><br/>-Rose Fielding <br/><br/>Dayleader: Linda Schneider <br/><br/>Count Team: Rose Fielding, Ren Chen, Roy Pisetsky, Deborah Crooks, Jim Yampolsky, Conner Cimmiyotti, Amy Gilgan <br/>

<p>Finally, a break from the rain! The day started off cold, windy, and cloudy but we were ready and determined to count. We slowly tallied up some of the usual birds as we awaited a special encounter. In the afternoon, the wind slowed, and the clouds began dispersing, allowing the sunlight to warm us up. I told the team I was ready for an eagle to come. Two minutes later, coming from the North quadrant was a large bird with massive wings - a Bald Eagle. We were able to pick up the white tail and big white head from afar but as it flew closer and southward, we could see some brown streaking on the head, indicating the plumage of a 4th year subadult Bald Eagle. Towards the end of our count, the fog rolled in and almost fully enveloped us, but we stood our ground and got to see the fog pass within 20 minutes. Glad we were able to count all day despite the slowness!

<p>We almost did some hawkatching today. We tried! The team waited for the morning weather to burn off before heading up to the hill around 10:30am. The weather was clear down below, but up at the hill we managed only a few glimpses of blue sky before the fog obstructed our views. Shortly thereafter, the rain began again. We retreated to the office for chili, deviled eggs, cheese, and cookies, periodically checking the status of the hill. “Yes, there’s still a mass of dark clouds looming over the hill.” “No, we probably shouldn’t go up there again.” A few of us went birding around the lagoon where we caught some glimpses of Golden-crowned Kinglets and discussed the finer points of gull identification.  <br/><br/>Thanks for the great season, Saturday 1!

<p>Today was the day of bountiful snacks and end of season hope. A warmer than expected morning yielded to a chilly and slightly windy afternoon with overcast skies. The day was pretty slow, but our fearless dayleader Mary Kenney called out bird requests to keep us scanning the hills. This resulted in single sightings of many species: Osprey, Red-shouldered Hawk, Ferruginous Hawk, Peregrine Falcon, White-tailed Kite, and even a juvenile Bald Eagle! We also had some American Kestrel and Northern Harrier flights to round things out. By the end of the day, we were shivering, but we still had cookies, muffins, strawberries, and fond memories of raptors flying over our heads. <br/><br/>Thanks so much for the awesome season, Tuesday 1.

<p>Today was a crisp, sunny, beautiful fall day in the headlands! As we enter the final two weeks of the 2024 season, the number of raptors counted per day is slowly dwindling but we are still seeing a good amount of species diversity. A highlight of the day was watching a male Northern Harrier, also known as a “Gray Ghost” for its pale smoky plumage, dip down below a ridge – and then as we were following it with our binoculars, another large bird rose up in front of us. After noting the pale underside, light base of the tail and outer wings, and wide yellow mouth gape, we were thrilled to call out a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk and watch it soar right overhead! These large buteos are always a treat to see from Hawk Hill. Other highlights included several close Peregrine Falcon sightings. We saw a very persistent Common Raven pair harassing every Red-tailed Hawk that flew into the vicinity; when one of the ravens turned its attention to a Peregrine and tried to annoy it, the falcon immediately put an end to that nonsense by giving the raven a taste of its own medicine and dive bombing it. Avian acrobatics are so fun! <br/><br/>-Rose Fielding <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Conner Cimmiyotti and Deborah Crooks <br/><br/>Count team: Linda Schneider, Mary Malec, Keith Gress, Maureen Grabowski, Sam Wong, Ren Chen, Holly Thomas, Wing Ng, Denise Peck, Darren Gross <br/>

<p>The day began with heavy fog, light winds, and temperatures around the high 50’s F. As we scanned the sky in attempts to see through the blur, we were able to detect some of the usual suspects. Many of the raptors seen today were silhouetted; we had the pleasure of observing a persistent American Kestrel harassing a Red-tailed Hawk in the white sky at a distance. When we did get lucky with a close bird, they were saturated with color from today’s interesting cool-toned wash over the landscape. In fact, the adult Sharp-shinned Hawk we saw at the 2nd hour had a beautiful ashy-blue dorsal side and a gorgeous rusty-orange ventral side. As the fog rolled in even more, hawk sightings dropped but we got to experience California Scrub Jays, Black Phoebes, and Northern Flickers in the odd lighting. They all ended up perching on Fish Rock in the North quadrant. My favorite view was of a male Northern Flicker stretching, flaunting his plumage. On the note of stunning plumage, we had multiple Northern Harriers fly by today. We had a pair flying south and steadily staying high in the sky, a pumpkin juvenile hunting, another juvenile that we thought was gray ghost from afar, and a few others. Overall, a slower day but it always feels good to watch and try to make sense of what the birds are doing and why. <br/><br/>-Ren Chen <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Ken Wilson & Becky Olsen <br/><br/>Count Team: Carol Weinstein, Ana Olivar, Laura Thomas, Ann Meisenger, Rose Fielding, Ren Chen <br/>

<p>Today held in store some unexpected sightings for the Saturday 2 team. We enjoyed mostly clear skies with some mid-morning haze that burned off before long, with temperatures in the high 50s. Mild winds began in the east and shifted to the west during the afternoon. The day began with a Peregrine Falcon right at 10am, shortly followed by a White-tailed Kite cruising low across the hills. We enjoyed several juvenile and male Northern Harrier sightings and saw a few male American Kestrels hunting around Slacker saddle. During a slow period, the North quadrant was surprised by a brief explosion of sparrow activity in the bushes, including some lovely Fox and Golden-crowned Sparrows. In the early afternoon we were working some typical birds out over the FM towers when Sam yelled, “Osprey”, from the West. It was dead ahead of the North platform, flying right at us. It proceeded to circle around giving us a magnificent view. A distant, challenging Ferruginous Hawk appeared as a speck over Hill 88 before testing the Hawkwatchers patience and identification skills as it cruised slowly (distantly) past the South platform toward the city, barely revealing its fieldmarks. A late season adult Broad-winged Hawk rode a thermal over Angel Island before disappearing into the sky. Two PM rolled around and with it came a West wind and two adult Bald Eagles from the North. We marveled at the eagles then got distracted tracking some birds to East, including a weird looking bird that turned into a dark morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawk. Then another Bald Eagle came into view. “Was that a new bird?” We scanned the sky for a few moments before the original two birds joined the third and rose up over Angel Island. Three adult Bald Eagles in one field of view: nice! <br/><br/>Thanks for everything team! <br/><br/>-Luke Scott <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Jan Ambrosini & Jane Rudebusch <br/><br/>Count Team: Tim Stroshane, Krish Maypole, Brian O’Laughlin, Sam Hontalas, Holly Thomas, Doris Rodriguez, Luke Scott <br/>

<p>A crisp and beautiful morning greeted today’s Hawkwatch team, with quite mild winds and open skies. After appearances from a few Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, Accipiters, and Asturs, a Merlin jetted into view giving us a nice show before heading south. The low winds made the hill feel warm despite temperatures in the 50s and 60s, and bird activity slowed down for a while. This absence of activity gave the team time to indulge in their end-of-season potluck. Yummy! After some delicious soup, sandwiches, cookies, muffins, and snacks, a couple of male Northern Harriers graced us with their presence around Slacker Saddle. They dipped around, giving us great looks, and even provoked an American Kestrel into diving on them. A few more late day Kestrels were spotted, as well as some juvenile Northern Harriers. “What a lovely, peaceful, afternoon,” we thought. However, the peace wouldn’t remain. The day ended with drama - of the avian variety. Just as the team was packing up to leave the hill, an adult Peregrine Falcon blasted across the sky and began relentlessly divebombing two juvenile Northern Harriers. Over and over the falcon lifted and stooped on the helpless Harriers. One of them even tumbled across the ground trying to evade its aggressor. After a few minutes the Harriers came to their wits and vacated the premises. As the falcon drama fizzled out, a new turf war was declared as an adult Red-tailed Hawk let out a resounding scream at a Common Raven. The two birds proceeded to scuffle and squabble directly over our heads, with plenty of Red-tail screams piercing the air. We watched this for a few moments, then finally got around to packing up, but before we could make it to the car, the word “EAGLE” was shouted across the platform. Sure enough, one late day juvenile Bald Eagle was soaring from Mt. Tam across the north quadrant, with a Common Raven on its heels. We took a good look then started to pack the car again, but a few seconds later the Peregrine showed back up. “Wait, no, two Peregrines!” They soared around the valley, up into the sky, and away. Quite the spectacle to end the day!  <br/><br/>Thanks for the potluck and the good times today! <br/><br/>-Luke Scott <br/><br/>Dayleader: Libby Rouan <br/><br/>Count Team: Will Ludan, Paulette Sherry, Nick Yatsko, Denise Peck, Lydia Bruno, Dan Knight, Holly Thomas, Keith Gress, Wing Ng, John Davis, Doris Rodriguez, Luke Scott <br/>

<p>No official count today, as the light rain that was forecasted became a downpour this morning! After being soaked to our skin, we decided to begrudgingly call it a day when it seemed the fog and rain would be sticking around. The afternoon cleared up beautifully later on though, so hopefully tomorrow’s team can take advantage of the clear skies and hungry raptors! <br/><br/>-Rose Fielding <br/><br/>Dayleader: Gretchen Zantzinger <br/><br/>Count Team: Tom Luster, John Davis, Pauline Yeckley, Megan Fradley-Smith <br/>

<p>This morning greeted us with chilly winds from the SE quadrant starting at 6mph and ramping up within a couple of hours. Before the storm kicked in, we saw some great sights of Sharpies getting pushed around in the gusts, Peregrine Falcons and a Merlin blazing through opposing winds, and an adult Bald Eagle lifting over the Bay. As the birds blew through, a male Northern Harrier swept through the hills, making his rounds around the observation deck as we all took moments to admire his beauty. By noon o’clock the rain and winds crashed through, pushing the counters off the Hill (this is our own form of migration).

<p>Today was a bright spot amid the forecasted rain for the week! We had clear skies, and a good amount of diversity with 10 different raptor species sighted. It was a great day for Peregrine Falcons, with a total of 7 speeding over the hill at different times. Two of the biggest highlights of the day both showed up in the East quadrant at separate times, giving us great close views as they flew above the Golden Gate Bridge – a Ferruginous Hawk and a White-tailed Kite! Both of the pale beauties were very obliging in allowing all of us to study them closely and look at their key identification markers.

<p>Despite a cold, wet, foggy start to the day, we ended up having a gorgeous afternoon up on the hill! We took shelter from the rain until noon, and decided to head up then for one last shot at counting raptors. We were rewarded for our perseverance almost immediately when a stunning adult Bald Eagle flew right over the hill heading south! We hoped that would be a good omen for the rest of the day, and while we did have some beautiful raptor sightings as always, we were not successful in finding the elusive late-season Rough-legged Hawk that we were wishing for. We did have some great American Kestrel and Northern Harrier sightings, as well as an abundance of acrobatic Red-tailed Hawks! <br/><br/>-Rose Fielding <br/><br/>Dayleader: Linda Schneider <br/><br/>Count Team: Deborah Crooks, Conner Cimmiyotti, Jim Yampolsky, Amy Gilgan <br/>

<p>The day started out rather smoky and hazy, but thankfully as the day went on the winds changed and it cleared into a bright, beautiful afternoon! Despite having relatively low numbers with a total count of 168 raptors, we still had some amazing sightings. One highlight was an eagle that the whole hill got to work on identifying together – and using clues such as head shape, feather mottling, and location of white markings, we were able to call it a subadult Bald Eagle! At the end of the day, a stunning male Northern Harrier showed off by slowly meandering above hillsides looking for an easy meal. As the late afternoon sun glinted off of his crisp gray and white plumage, we found ourselves wishing one of our photographer friends was on the hill – alas, we’ll just have to remember the moment in our minds! <br/><br/>-Rose Fielding <br/><br/>Dayleader: Sam Hontalas <br/><br/>Count team: Laura Coatney, Melissa Kohner, Annalise Fox, Jon Altemus, Dani Christensen <br/>

<p>Today was another beautiful day with temperatures in the mid 60s, variable light wind, and mostly clear skies. A light haze hung around in the distance, and as the day began, we watched some low fog roll in from the West, though it never obscured our views of the sky. The low fog dissipated before long, and the rest of the day was clear and sunny. Today’s count was one of fairly high numbers, but low species diversity for this time in the season. We counted lots of Red-tailed Hawks, studying them closely, trying to turn them into Rough-legged Hawks, but no one was able to conjure one up. The Red-tailed Hawk and Turkey Vulture count was punctuated by great looks at Sharp-shinned and Cooper’s Hawks flying low over the hill every 15 or 20 minutes, as well as some distant American Kestrels and Northern Harriers. We also spotted some American White Pelicans! The somewhat slow day allowed the team to chat with some interested visitors on the hill who were excited to see a Red-tailed Hawk perched in the West quadrant. We also had the opportunity to visit with some great friends on the hill today! <br/><br/>Looking forward to the next count, thanks for doing what you do team! <br/><br/>Luke Scott <br/><br/>Dayleader: Mary Malec <br/><br/>Count Team: Melissa Hero, Chris Cruz, Carole Garrett, Holly Thomas, John Davis, Robyn Boothby, Doris Rodriguez, Luke Scott <br/>

<p>The atmosphere on Hawk Hill was pleasant today, dare I say peaceful, with clear skies, perfect mid-60 temperatures, and mild winds that shifted from East to West as the day moved on. The flight started slow, but before long a juvenile Peregrine Falcon cruised from the East, low over the hill, gracing the Hawkwatchers with its presence. Just after 11am the air of peace gave way to a joyous cacophony of 1st graders (future Hawkwatchers) that stormed the hill to learn about raptors. They were eager to look through the GGRO scopes, and we were pleased to overhear debates among the youngsters over whether the Turkey Vultures they were seeing were new or already counted! Big thanks to Karen Offereins from the Community Stewardship and Engagement team for helping us interface with the kids today. The children soon moved on to greener pastures (for snack time) and the air of peace returned, bringing with it an adult Bald Eagle from the North quadrant! Other highlights included a great look at a White-tailed Kite flying North, as well as a few Red-shouldered Hawks, American Kestrels, and Merlins. Still no pizza party, though!  <br/><br/>Thanks for another wonderful day on the Hill team! <br/><br/>Luke Scott <br/><br/>Dayleader: Holly Thomas <br/><br/>Count Team: Tomas McKay, Nick Yatsko, Yvette MacDonald, Sonja Raub, Denise Peck, Pauline Yeckley, Wing Ng, Carmen DeLeon, Doris Rodriguez, Luke Scott <br/>

<p>This was another wonderful late season day with intermittent moderate West/Northwest winds, clear skies, and temperatures in the mid 60s. Somewhat strange thermals provided the South quadrant with small kettles of raptors popping up beyond the south platform. We had great looks at Northern Harriers, a few American Kestrels flying over the shipping channel, and some distant White-tailed Kites, Merlins, and a Peregrine Falcon. Later in the day, our Dayleader John Davis pointed out a bird in the East quadrant, asking me what it was. I casually replied, “Turkey Vulture”, before turning away. John said, “No, it’s not.... DARK MORPH FERRUGINOUS HAWK!”. Nice bird! The latter part of the day slowed down, but around 2:50pm, another shout from John Davis rang out, this time from the West quadrant: “Good bird, really, REALLY good bird!”. I abandoned my quadrant, running toward the West just in time to see what we thought was a Short-eared Owl swooping across the landscape and landing on a shrubby perch. The owl then lifted its long ears, and we noticed its slender physique and pumpkin-colored cheeks. The following question was uttered several times: “Is this the first Long-eared Owl ever seen at Hawk Hill???” <br/><br/>Thanks for the great day team! <br/><br/>Luke Scott <br/><br/>Dayleader: John Davis <br/><br/>Count Team: Susan Greef, Arden Bucklin-Sporer, Patricia Contaxis, Lydia Bruno, Ashley Friscia, Wing Ng, Ren Chen, Carmen DeLeon, Doris Rodriguez, Luke Scott <br/>

<p>What a nice day to spend not thinking about anything but raptors. A slightly overcast morning gave rise to some late sun, with moderate temperatures, and variable winds of moderate strength. The Red-tailed Hawks were out in full force today, with a whopping 140 sightings! We also saw many Northern Harriers, including two juveniles that seemed to be following each other and hunting. I arrived at the hill a little late and was greeted by an adult Peregrine Falcon flying low right over the hill. What a wonderful way to start the day! In the early afternoon a Ferruginous Hawk flew past the south platform, and we had a few moments of chaotic Sharp-shinned Hawk sightings. The real treat today was an unbelievable look at an adult Golden Eagle that flew from the Northwest, soaring low directly over the Hawkwatchers, before continuing South over the city. What a sight!

<p>Another warm, mid to high 60’s F, blue-sky day with only occasional light gusts of wind. We started out captivated by an unordinary raptor visitor, a Short-eared Owl! Throughout the day we saw many of our ordinary birds as well—lots of Red-tailed Hawks. One of the Red-tailed Hawks was a dark morph juvenile that flew into every quadrant giving us stunning eye-level looks. We got some fun views of raptors on their journeys and raptors lingering too: mid-count, the team spotted a close Osprey that had a determined path juxtaposed to later observing a Northern Harrier hunting around. We were also entertained with less common overhead looks at a White-tailed Kite and a male American Kestrel. Some other exciting flying creatures were all the orange Vanessa genus butterflies fluttering about as we counted. <br/><br/>-Ren Chen <br/><br/>Dayleader: Deborah Crooks <br/><br/>Count Team: Keith Gress, Linda Schneider, Mary Malec, Sam Wong, Step Wilson, John Davis, Denise Peck, Anne Ross, Rose Fielding, Ren Chen <br/>

<p>Clear blue skies and light bursts of wind coupled with mid to high 60’s F temperature all day made for small group flurries of raptors moving through Hawk Hill today. Most of the birds we saw were remarkably high up and/or at a distance. Most notably, the juvenile Golden Eagle that almost blended in with a group of five Turkey Vultures. We are all inspecting the Turkey Vultures after yesterday’s surprise! After some time straining our eyes to find birds far away, we got great looks at a male Northern Harrier and a light-colored Merlin.

<p>Last night’s rain blew in crisp NW winds and low temperatures, pushing a small trickle of late season Sharp-shinned Hawks, followed by splendid views of two juvenile Red-shouldered Hawks, and a hunting American Kestrel. The dewy morning also included appearances of two gray ghosts (adult male Northern Harriers) gliding through the headlands! The biggest highlight of the day was when Hawkwatchers stumbled on a dark vulture-like silhouetted bird. What could this possibly be? Our bird teetered along the wind, until someone yelled out...

<p>Blue sky and sunshine managed to peek through the thick fog while we were in the parking lot, but the lofty layer quickly erased the west quadrant from view once we arrived at the hill. A small opening over the bay allowed us to spot Red-tailed Hawks rising over the trees before our view vanished again. There were whispers of a southwest wind with temperatures in the mid 50’s-low 60’s F.

<p>Happy Harrier H-wednesday! It was a cold and slow start to the day with persistent haze surrounding us as raptor sightings drifted in and out of the blur. Light west winds were up to 3 mph with temperatures in the low 60’s F. Northern Harriers led the morning, drifting by through the valley. We were excited to see an adult male Northern Harrier, with its cloudy grey plumage perfectly matching the surroundings. A Merlin swooped around the count area rising high above the bay and a flow of Red-tailed Hawks rounded out our midday. Later in the afternoon, the sky somewhat cleared with more sun beaming through the clouds. With more... Harriers popping in from the rolling hills!

<p>Today we were treated to a beautiful display of ever-changing light and clouds. The skies remained clear enough to get a full day of counting in, and although the numbers were fairly low, we still had some lovely close sightings! Several adult Red-tailed Hawks hovered close overhead, giving us amazing views of their autumn-themed plumage coloration. We also got great looks at an adult Peregrine Falcon that spent some time zipping around annoying both a raven and a redtail. Despite the slow day, we still had fun enjoying the beauty of the Headlands! <br/><br/>-Rose Fielding <br/><br/>Dayleader: Linda Schneider <br/><br/>Count Team: Roy Pisetsky, Deborah Crooks, Jim Yampolsky, Amy Gilgan, Ren Chen, John Davis, Holly Thomas, Keith Gress <br/>

<p>The streak of clear, sunny skies has been broken – unfortunately we were fogged out from counting on the hill today. However, we had a great walk around the lagoon instead and even managed to see a Turkey Vulture and a Red-tailed Hawk fly by – so it wasn’t a totally raptor-less day! We were also reminded to look down occasionally when we saw a beautiful banana slug meandering across the path. Sometimes it’s nice to have a bit of a reminder to enjoy all the beauty around us, not just the things that are high in the sky! <br/><br/>-Rose Fielding <br/><br/>Dayleader: Sam Hontalas <br/><br/>Count Team: Melissa Kohner, Alex Cox, Parker Holzman Smith <br/>

<p>A slow windless morning gave rise to a day with high species diversity and plenty of good snacks. The sky was slightly overcast, creeping towards nearly total cloud coverage by 3pm, with some light variable winds that raptors seemed to opportunistically ride. The Falcons were out today: we had five Peregrine Falcon sightings, three Merlins, and two American Kestrels. We also saw a single beautiful adult Broad-winged Hawk. My personal highlight was seeing the two Ospreys soaring over Hill 88. One of them disappeared, but the other slowly made its way over to the hill giving the Hawkwatchers a nice look.

<p>Two Peregrine Falcons welcomed us to a slightly overcast morning on the hill today. It was a bit slow, but before long we were surprised by a beautiful late season dark morph juvenile Broad-winged Hawk flying south past the hill towards the city! It was also a good day for male American Kestrels, with lots of hunting activity observed. The afternoon lull was substantial, but then a west wind picked up and with it came an Osprey, a Merlin, and some great looks at adult Sharp-shinned and Cooper’s Hawks.

<p>It was a great day of autumn skies with glowing sunshine. There was light cloud cover and haze with short wisps of 3 MPH west wind and temperatures in the low 70’s. There was not a Peregrine Falcon to be found, but a big afternoon surprise instead! Hawkwatchers spotted a lanky looking bird eating an insect on the wing. It flew around the count area, glowing against the south quadrant sun. As the team felt puzzled by the slow flapping and slender, yet raggedy wing shape, they repeatedly remarked, “What a weird bird! It can’t possibly be a falcon, but what else could it be?” Ever thankful for digital photos, the team “time travelled” to contemplate their identification and concluded that it was a Mississippi Kite! Mississippi Kites are typically found in the outer south-central U.S. and continue down eastern Mexico and into South America. This is an extremely rare sighting for Hawk Hill and a delight for the whole team to experience. <br/><br/>Carmen DeLeon <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Courtney Buechert & Jon Altemus <br/><br/>Count Team: Jan Ambrosini, Wing Ng, Kimberlie Moutoux, Kendra Armer, Brian O’Laughlin, Don Bartling, Holly Thomas, Heller Stanton, Rose Fielding <br/>

<p>The fog and wind rolled in and out today, along with occasional glimpses of sunlight. The weather stayed in the 50s and 60s today which is a welcoming shift from the hot days we’ve been having on the hill. Today was filled with high numbers of accipiters and more sightings of adult raptors than the beginning of the season. We saw plenty of interspecies interactions, many being between ravens and buteos-- Red-tailed Hawks and a Red-shouldered Hawk. We even witnessed some nice close-up intraspecies interactions between Sharp-shinned Hawks and Red-tailed Hawks doing flips in the air! Some cool solo bird sightings include nice views of a Merlin, and later a Peregrine Falcon. There was even a juvenile Cooper’s Hawk that perched along the railing by the wingspan diagram, giving us a great look at its features. I can go on about all the fascinating sightings today, but I’ll end with this: the birds are migrating and along the way they’re giving us some wonderfully exciting glances that I’ll never get tired of. <br/><br/>-Ren Chen <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Mary Kenney & Andy Bradshaw <br/><br/>Count Team: Chris Tarr, Woody Woodbury, Paula Moser, John Davis, Rose Fielding, Luke Scott, Ren Chen <br/>

<p>Today’s weather proved to be much chillier and breezier on the hill, but we still had a great day of counting! Although the raptor numbers weren’t as high as other days, there were several entertaining bird interactions that were great highlights. We got to see two Peregrine Falcons involved in a skirmish, a juvenile Northern Harrier and an adult Red-tailed Hawk chasing each other, and at the very end of the day as we were packing up a male and female American Kestrel treated us to a close fly by as they zipped through the sky together.

<p>It was sunny and clear all day, getting warm and still in the late afternoon with highs in the upper 70’s. Winds were minimal from the southeast, dying down completely at the end of the day. We were delighted by many Red-tailed Hawks soaring close above the quadrants and good looks at Sharp-shinned Hawks fluttering in from the west and crossing the bay. We were also happy to see a beautiful adult male Northern Harrier, nicknamed the “gray ghost” for its distinct plumage which contrasts with the pumpkin orange glow of the juveniles.

<p>After 5 days in a row of clear skies and full counts, the fog had other plans for our Wednesday team today. Unfortunately, we were not able to get an official count in due to the fog shrouding Hawk Hill throughout the morning and afternoon. However, we still had some avian entertainment watching a newly hatched baby quail scratching around on the ground during our morning meeting! We decided to change things up a bit and do some raptor ID quizzes back at the GGRO office, which was a fun way to practice and talk through tricky identification issues. We even saw a lone juvenile Red-tailed Hawk and a Turkey Vulture fly over the office building, so at least it wasn’t a totally raptor-less day! The fog provided a welcome break from the heat wave that hit the hill during yesterday’s count, which is one silver lining.

<p>Light eastward breezes started up as we arrived on Hawk Hill circa 945 am, and temps rose slowly from low 70s to mid 80s through the day. In the early afternoon, the wind fell off, increasing temps to a high of 87-deg. The 2-3 pm hour brought some much-appreciated cooling west winds to finish the day. <br/><br/>We had a good range of species today with close looks at Red-shouldered and Cooper’s Hawks. There seemed to be an American Kestel scooting by every ½ hour or so, although many of them stalled long enough to catch a few dragonflies en route.  The Red-tailed Hawks mostly worked the Slacker ridgeline above Sausalito all day.   <br/><br/>There were a good number of dragonflies aloft today – it was difficult to put your binoculars in the sky anywhere and not have 2+ dragonflies in your field.  Most common were Common Green Darners, Variegated Meadowhawks, Black Saddlebags, Flame Skimmers, and Blue Mosaic spp. Also lots of insectivore birds, especially swifts and swallows, as well as Blue-Gray Gnatcatchers all over Hawk Hill. <br/><br/>- Allen Fish <br/><br/>Dayleader: Mary Kenney <br/><br/>Count team: Nat Smale, Dan Foldes, Maureen Grabowski, Woody Woodbury, Dennis Davison, Holly Thomas, Allen Fish <br/>

<p>We couldn’t have asked for better Labor Day weather – the skies were sunny, and a consistent delightful breeze kept things from getting oppressively hot on top of the hill. Lots of human and avian visitors came by Hawk Hill today! We ended up counting 182 raptors; the steady increase in raptors counted per day is giving us a good reminder that peak season is just around the corner. There was a healthy diversity of 8 species counted, including another Merlin and the second Sharp-shinned Hawk of the season! We were treated to some incredible aerial acrobatics when a male American Kestrel and a juvenile Sharp-shinned Hawk got into a bit of a tussle right at eye level with the counting team. Both birds flew off with their feathers and egos intact, and we all marveled at the show.

<p>It was a beautiful clear and sunny morning on Hawk Hill with temperatures in the high 60 to lower 70 degrees F range. The Northwest winds got progressively stronger as the morning turned into afternoon. A slow start gave Luke and Carmen time to continue setting up the well-loved wingspan diagram while the rest of the team tallied up some Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, and a single Northern Harrier. As the afternoon came around some Cooper’s Hawks and American Kestrels began to appear, as well as three Osprey! Additionally, juvenile and adult dark morph Red-tailed Hawks were spotted, much to the delight of the hawkwatchers.  <br/><br/>-Luke Scott <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Mary Malec, Brian O’Laughlin <br/><br/>Count Team: Melissa Hero, Chris Cruz, Carole Garrett, Ben Dudek, Carmen DeLeon, Luke Scott, Allen Fish<br/>

<p>At the day's start, the 100% high overcast gave us our first view of Hawk Hill since Tuesday.  The day was breezy – up to 26 mph from the west – and stayed between 65-70 deg F. By mid-day the overcast was done and we could see a full 360-degree sky. <br/><br/>We enjoyed a steady Red-tailed Hawk flight with a good run of Turkey Vultures as well - interrupted here and there by single Ospreys, American Kestrels, and Cooper’s Hawks.  A pair of juvenile Red-shouldered Hawks flew by together.  The Sharp-shinned Hawks are still scarce. <br/><br/>- Allen Fish  <br/><br/>Dayleader: Holly Thomas <br/><br/>Count Team: Nick Yatsko, Wing Ng, Sonja Raub, Ma’ayan Pe’er, Denise Peck, Yvette MacDonald, Allen Fish <br/><br/> <br/>

<p>The fog continued to haunt us today, but we still had an excellent morning! With visibility obscured on the hill in the morning, we meandered down to the lagoon to see if the birds there would be cooperative. We were treated to views of all our local favorites – herons, egrets, cormorants, kingfishers, pelicans, mallards, warblers, hummingbirds, bushtits, and more! Even the raptors gave us a few consolation glimpses – we saw a Red-tailed Hawk and several Turkey Vultures as we passed the time eating lunch at the lagoon. We returned to the hill at 1:00 for one last look; our hopes were momentarily raised when we saw a patch of sunny sky to the northeast, but they were quickly dashed when the fog blew in again on a cold breeze. Oh well – better luck to tomorrow’s crew! <br/><br/>-Rose Fielding <br/><br/>Dayleader: Christine Carino <br/><br/>Count Team: Bob Blumberg, Susan Greef, Arden Bucklin-Sporer, Patricia Contaxis, Lydia Bruno, Ashley Friscia, Rose Fielding <br/>

<p>After three full-day counts and sunny skies, thick fog attached itself to Hawk Hill through 1 pm today, rendering no chance at a hawk migration count. The count team retreated to Rodeo Lagoon for a little training on Red-tailed Hawk plumages and ageing, and we discovered that the two grandmother eucalyptuses in front of the Ft Barry Chapel are a superb songbird magnet. In 30 minutes we observed: Western Tanagers, Swainson’s Thrush, Olive-sided Flycatcher, Pine Siskin, Lesser Goldfinch, Wilson’s Warbler, Pygmy Nuthatch, Allen's and Anna's Hummingbird, Western Flycatcher, Nuttall's Woodpecker, and Townsend’s Warblers. <br/><br/>Rodeo Lagoon also produced some great bird looks: a royal flush of herons and egrets; 45 Brown Pelicans; a Belted King (Queen) fisher, and a single butt-bobbing Wilson’s Snipe.  Where are the Red-necked Phalaropes? A few Turkey Vultures gave us passing looks this morning, as did one Redtail.

<p>Tuesday 1 – 8/27/2024 <br/><br/>The fog was thick this morning over Rodeo Lagoon and the Golden Gate Bridge, but Hawk Hill was clear and calm with visibility all the way to Mount Diablo. The windless and hot morning might have been tiresome if it wasn’t for the Prairie Falcon spotted perched on a rock on the South side of the hill! Almost as soon as the words “Prairie Falcon” were uttered the bird took flight, disappearing to the southwest for a few moments, before circling back and jetting past the hill towards San Francisco. This was the first Prairie Falcon seen from Hawk Hill this season: not a bad start to the day! The exciting start to the day was followed by a sporadic flurry of American Kestrels darting past the hill. Later in the day a west wind picked up a bit, allowing us some reprieve from the heat as a gradual stream of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures floated around. We also spotted the resident Peregrine Falcon sitting on the north tower of the bridge and were pleased to see a few Cooper’s Hawks and Northern Harriers fly by the hill.

<p>Today started off slow, still, and hot. Without much of a breeze to encourage them, the raptors stayed hidden for most of the morning with only the occasional Turkey Vulture or Red-tailed Hawk making an appearance. However, by midafternoon we started getting quite a show! The team ended up with 10 American Kestrel sightings, which is a record for the 2024 season so far. One female kestrel even treated us to a close, eye-level fly by that had us all exclaiming with joy; whether it’s the first time or the 1000th time you’ve seen a kestrel up close, it just never gets old!  <br/><br/>In addition to the kestrels, we had another momentous sighting – the first Swainson’s Hawk of the season! These unique buteos aren’t seen from Hawk Hill very often, so getting a visual of one is always special. This juvenile spent some time circling with a few Red-tailed Hawks before taking off and continuing its journey.  <br/><br/>Looking forward to seeing what excitement the migration brings us tomorrow!

<p>A happy sunny Sunday today! It was consistently hot and clear outside all day. There was minimal wind with it picking up just a tad towards the last hour. Our count started at 11am today, after our introductions and raptor identification refreshers. The raptor pop quiz was a helpful reminder, especially when we got a wonderful look at a mysterious accipiter in the first hour. We identified it as a Cooper’s Hawk after seeing a rounded tail and stiff wing beats, among other fieldmarks. Throughout the day, we got a plethora of other raptors, and non-raptor birds flying both near and far. Notably, the pair of American Kestrels (male & female) that we saw during the second half of our count. It was truly a joy to experience the kestrels dancing in the sky and showing off in every quadrant! In another perspective, the Red-tailed Hawks in the area appeared to not be fond of this and dove at the kestrels several times, successfully driving them away from the area. With the rain yesterday, and the nice weather today, we ended up seeing 7 raptor species (and 6 other bird species), including our first Sharp-shinned Hawk of the season. The raptor sightings were fairly stable, with a rate of 39 raptors an hour today. What a day to cap cycle 2! <br/><br/>-Ren <br/><br/>Dayleader: Becky Olsen and Ken Wilson <br/><br/>Count Team: Carol Weinstein, Maggie Montenegro, Laura Thomas, Ann Meisenger, Holly Thomas, Rose Fielding, Ren Chen <br/>

<p>Saturday 2 – Aug 24, 2024 <br/><br/>It wasn’t just foggy this morning, but rainy too! We met up at Hawk Hill and promptly hid out in the battery to get out of the rain while exchanging movie recommendations and introductions. Before too long the rain stopped and some clear sky opened, but a thick layer of fog remained looming over the hill preventing us from counting raptors. The team headed down to Rodeo Lagoon where we talked about the influence of topography and wind direction on raptor movements in the Marin Headlands. We even spotted a Belted Kingfisher (though I was pretty sure it was a Ringed...shoutout to John Davis for reminding me that I don’t live in Texas anymore!). The weather below Hawk Hill teased us with blue skies and warm air, but the top of the hill remained shrouded in fog, dashing our hopes for hawk spotting. We shared some consolatory chocolates and ginger snaps and assured one another that next week the fog would clear for us! <br/><br/>Luke Scott <br/><br/>Dayleader: Jan Ambrosini <br/><br/>Count Team: Jennifer Miller, Maryrose Kulick, Krish Maypole, Sam Hontalas, Carmen DeLeon, Luke Scott, Allen Fish <br/>

<p>Today’s fog and wind was a bit indecisive, it started out strong in the morning and began lifting towards the afternoon. Throughout the day, the fog continued to come through in short spurts. Meanwhile, the wind was the fastest when we first started and in the last hour. We started the count at 11:15am and in the first hour we were greeted with Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, and the first (official) Osprey of the season! Sometime between 1-2pm, another Osprey came by, and we were all captivated by all the angles it was giving us. It was fun getting such a great look. We also saw two Cooper’s Hawks zooming by, giving us 4 total species.

<p>Wednesday 2 – 8/21/2024 <br/><br/>The fog in the headlands seemed to concentrate directly at the top of Hawk Hill today, so today’s team couldn’t count hawks. Instead, we convened down at the lagoon for some birding and a short walk. We saw a family of river otters tumbling around in the lagoon, plenty of Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets, Brown Pelicans, a Belted Kingfisher and an Osprey. We sat down for lunch and watched some Red-tailed Hawks soaring around under the fog, spotted a juvenile Northern Harrier, a female Western Tanager, and plenty of American Goldfinches.

<p>After lots of summer fog, it was downright confusing to see miles of clear skies over SF Bay today.  We finally found the fog bank cloaking the Farallones, 26 miles away, but it stayed offshore which was just fine with us.  Morning still winds and warm air (75-deg) turned to a stiff west wind in the afternoon.  The hawks were mostly working the ridges, and mostly juvenile Red-tailed Hawks, with a few Cooper’s Hawks and Northern Harriers thrown in. <br/><br/>The “best” bird of the day was a juvenile Bald Eagle spotted just west of Hawk Hill by Hawkwatch Manager Rose Fielding as she was driving, and so didn’t make it on to the official count.  But it’s great to know these young eagles are moving around. <br/><br/>Another non-Hawk Hill raptor note: Thanks to Deborah Crooks and Ben Dudek for alerting us to the California Condor sighting/photo by George Chrisman on Mines Road east of Livermore yesterday – a mere 60 miles straight-line distance from the Golden Gate. <br/><br/>- Allen Fish <br/><br/>Dayleader: Horacio Mena <br/><br/>Count Team: Woody Woodbury, Dennis Davison, Dan Foldes, Nate Smale, Holly Thomas, Wing Ng, Lisa Sargent, Ren Chen, Sam Hontalas <br/>

Luckily it didn’t last long, and the sun reappeared long enough to warm us up and usher in some new raptors with a nice breeze. A highlight of the day was spotting 7 American Kestrels, which was quite a treat!

<p>A fog-free Hawk Hill became partially fogged by 11 am, then it was as if the fog was a giant wave, ebbing and flowing throughout the day – at least 5 ins and outs.  Big westerlies blew through the day spiking at 18 mph but mostly in the 6-10 mph range.  <br/><br/>Most of the raptor activity was a steady dance of juvenile Red-tailed Hawks stringing along the Slacker Ridge above Hwy 101, and a few close Cooper’s Hawk flybys, and a wonderful braiding flight by three female American Kestrels.  Late in the day a juvenile Bald Eagle (brown belly, white wingpits, big dark head) made a slow and direct flight north to south across the west side of Hawk Hill, barely noticing the slamming west winds.  The eagle tracked right across the Golden Gate heading toward Baker Beach, San Francisco.

We started the count at 11:30 am and our optimism brought out 2 female American Kestrels from the fog. Eventually a Red-tailed Hawk and Turkey Vulture popped out of the fog as well.

<p>Our favorite holiday is here – it’s the first official day of the Hawkwatch season! The day started off cold and thick with fog, and it didn’t show any signs of relenting as we spent the morning doing introductions and getting back into the migration season mindset. At 12:45, we were about ready to call it a day and have our dreams of Hawkwatching dashed – but luckily, the rest of the team was more optimistic than the staff members, and we decided to head up the hill for one last look just in case. <br/><br/>It’s a good thing we did – the fog lifted enough to give us one amazing, sunny hour of counting! We saw 23 Red-tailed Hawks, 5 Turkey Vultures, 2 beautiful juvenile Northern Harriers, and one lone Cooper’s Hawk for some accipiter representation. Not bad for one hour of data collection! <br/><br/>What a lovely start to the season – can't wait to do it all again tomorrow! <br/><br/>–Rose Fielding <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Deborah Crooks, Conner Cimmiyotti <br/><br/>Count Team: Linda Schneider, Keith Gress, Sam Wong, Mary Malec, Wing Ng, Maureen Grabowski, Rose Fielding, Allen Fish <br/>
