<p>Well folks, that's a wrap for the 2023 GGRO Hawkwatch season! We wish the weather had gotten the memo, but unfortunately, the fog kept us from collecting any data today. Instead, we took a nice walk along Rodeo Lagoon and spotted several waterfowl species, including Buffleheads, Ring-necked Ducks, Common Goldeneyes, and a pair of Redheads. Despite the fog, we had a nice lunch atop the hill and spent some time enjoying each other's company before calling it a day. Thanks to all our amazing volunteers for a wonderful season. Until next fall! <br/><br/>-Isabella Plummer <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Ken Wilson, Becky Olsen <br/><br/>Count Team: Cody Levin, Kinley Renger, Maggie Montenegro, Ana Olivar, Carol Weinstein, Allen Fish, Krista Fanucchi, Isabella Plummer <br/>

<p>It was a damp day to end the season with for our Saturday 2 team, but spirits remained high and we made the most of our last hours together. After meeting briefly in the visitor center parking lot, we returned to building 1064 to share snacks and conversation, as well as educate ourselves using a few of the preserved raptor specimens from the GGRO vaults. With our curiosity and appetites sated, the beach beckoned and we ventured out to comb the sands, comparing nuggets of vibrant stone, wave-worn sea glass, and fiery carnelian. Having returned these motes of earth to the beach mélange, we parted ways and wished one another well. Until next year! <br/><br/>- Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Jane Rudebusch, Jan Ambrosini <br/><br/>Count Team: Jennifer Miller, Tim Stroshane, Erin Lacour, Brian Kemler, Laura Echávez, Carmen DeLeon, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<p>Our Friday 2 team could not have asked for a more pleasant day on Hawk Hill to conclude the season! With great visibility, mixed clouds and sun, temperatures in the low 60 degrees F, and mild variable wind, we were able to both hawkwatch and consume potluck dishes comfortably! As expected, we didn't have an influx of raptors, but that made what we saw even more eventful. The team was able to enjoy views of adult Peregrine Falcons swooping by the hill, juvenile and adult male and female Northern Harriers hunting acrobatically, and late-migrating Red-tailed Hawk after Red-tailed Hawk flying from north to the southeast.  <br/><br/>We're sad this is our last day on Hawk Hill together, but everyone is already looking forward to experiencing more of these beautiful raptors in one another's company next season! <br/><br/>-Clare SantaColoma <br/><br/>Dayleader: Courtney Buechert, Libby Rouan <br/><br/>Count Team: Chris Cruz, Nick Yatsko, Paulette Sherry, Tomas McKay, Will Ludan <br/>

<p>Today made for a spectacular conclusion to the season for our Thursday 2 team, with lovely weather and a great range of raptor species on the hill. It was sunny and clear all day, with a light breeze that escalated to a gusty wind from the west in the early afternoon before calming down again during the last hour of the count. From the hilltop we clocked gusts up to 25mph, and at times the wind howled audibly through the cables of the Golden Gate bridge. Beautiful cumulus clouds lined the horizon, and temperatures ranged from the high 50s to the low 60s.  <br/><br/>The raptor species diversity stole the show today, especially for this late in the season! A number of unexpected species cropped up, including an Osprey, a Broad-winged Hawk, and a Ferruginous Hawk. We also picked up a sub-adult Bald Eagle as it was being harassed by a pair of Peregrine Falcons - always a dramatic sight! A big thank you to our wonderful Thursday 2 volunteers, it was a memorable day to close with and we'll see you next season! <br/><br/>- Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleader: Christine Cariño <br/><br/>Count Team: Jim Yampolsky, Pauline Yeckley, Patricia Contaxis, Lydia Bruno, Laura Echávez, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<p>We definitely had some late fall weather with late fall raptor activity for Wednesday 2's last day of the season. Gusty winds from the north made the frigid low 50s temperature feel even colder, but luckily once we got some sunshine, we were able to warm ourselves up. As we chatted in the parking lot before starting the count, we watched the adult pair of Peregrine Falcons in their usual haunt above Kirby Cove, but unfortunately, they didn't feel like being included in our official tally for the day since we never saw them again. Of the four species we saw today, Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures made up the vast majority of our sightings. But that just meant we got to appreciate the endless diversity of Red-tailed Hawk plumages as they soared around us. Thanks to the Wednesday 2 team for always being a pleasure to hawkwatch with!

<p>As all good things come to a close, so must it be for our Tuesday 2 Hawkwatch team. It was a worthy day to end on - clear skies, a breeze from the east, and pleasant temperatures on the hilltop. And most importantly, birds to count! It was a relatively quiet day, to be expected for the tail-end of the season. Our count was dominated by Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures; though a fairly distant sub-adult Bald Eagle was spotted near Mt. Tam in the afternoon, continuing our streak during this final week. Our day was rounded out with an abundance of snacks and goodwill as the team made their goodbyes and departed the hill. Thank you to all who contributed to making this team great, and we look forward to next year! <br/><br/>- Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleader: Horacio Mena <br/><br/>Count Team: Dan Foldes, Woody Woodbury, Maureen Grabowski, Dennis Davison, Mary Kenney, Allen Fish, Juan Esparza, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<p>We couldn't have asked for a more pleasant day for the last Monday 2 of the season. Although the day started out with gusty winds from the northeast, the winds died down in the afternoon and we had mostly clear skies with temperatures in the high 50s. We experienced a bit of a late season spike in raptor activity, spotting several small kettles of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures. We were also excited to get a fairly close view of an adult Bald Eagle as it swiftly headed south past the Golden Gate. Some folks were lucky enough to see a second, much more distant adult Bald Eagle later in the day, too. And just as we were about to finish up our count, a juvenile Northern Harrier graced us with its presence, bringing our raptor species total for the day up to 7.

<p>Unruly winds and cold temperatures welcomed us atop Hawk Hill today. Throughout the day, temperatures hovered in the high 50s, keeping Sunday 1's team layered up and reaching out for more layers. The skies were clear but with some high clouds towards the south. Although this team was met with such fierce, brisk conditions, they were ready to brave it through to get the last count for this team in for the season.  <br/><br/>As is typical for the tail end of the fall migration, many of the birds seen today were Red-tailed Hawks. Although late into the morning we were lucky enough to see not just one, but two adult Bald Eagles! They were flying across the sky together, tussling at points before disappearing into the northeast. Winds died down by early afternoon, as did raptor activity. It was a good day for Sundays 1's team. We hope that the rest of the teams end off with some great sights as well! <br/><br/>-Juan Esparza <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Sam Hontalas, Rod Santos <br/><br/>Count Team: Melissa Kohner, Alexandra Cox, Parker Holzman Smith, Mona Broukhim, Laura Echávez, Juan Esparza <br/>

<p>Our final Saturday 1 of the 2023 season was dominated by delicious potluck food, visitors from other days and years, Hawkwatch jeopardy, and of course- some raptors! Gusty winds from the northeast between 9-13 m.p.h. were consistent throughout the day alongside clear blue skies and chilly temperatures in the mid 50 degrees F; making for some bundled hawkwatchers. As can be typical of late November, raptors were fewer and farther between than earlier in the season. However, we got some great looks at juvenile and adult Red-tailed Hawks, a close-flying male American Kestrel, some accipiters, and even a subadult Bald Eagle! Rivaling in importance to today's raptor count, it was also one of our beloved volunteer's last days up on Hawk Hill after a solid 25 years. So of course, a potluck celebration was in order! Hawkwatchers from other days came to join in the celebration, and we ate, chatted and played bird jeopardy (Allen's creation).  <br/><br/>Thanks to everyone on Saturday 1 for a great season! Rain, sun or fog- we always had a blast spending the day together. Looking forward to all the laughs and raptors that 2024 is sure to bring. <br/><br/>-Clare SantaColoma <br/><br/>Dayleader: Brian O'Laughlin, Mary Malec <br/><br/>Count Team: JJ Harris, Jeff Boissier, Rina Kor, Carole Garrett, Krista Fanucchi, Carmen DeLeon, Clare SantaColoma <br/>

<p>The hill was abuzz today with both birds and people! The holiday brought many visitors, birders and tourists alike who came to enjoy the beautiful, clear day. Intermittent winds from the southeast clocked in at 8-10mph during the morning and died to a whisper in the afternoon. Sunny and clear all day, with expansive sightlines and temperatures in the high 50s to low 60s F.  <br/><br/>Most of today's birds were distant and appeared along the north and western skylines, making for a dizzying day of identifying far-flung bird-specks. Good practice for getting familiar with the scopes! We had a good range of species today and an overall high count for this late in the season, powered by our perennial friends the Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures. A wonderful day to end the field season for our Friday 1 team.  <br/><br/>-Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleader: Holly Thomas <br/><br/>Count Team: Laura Thomas, Yvette MacDonald, Sonja Raub, Courtney Buechert, Nick Yatsko, Laura Echávez, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<p>11/23/23 - Thursday 1 <br/><br/>The Thanksgiving hawk count was a short day, only a three-hour count, kept by a few but mighty hawk counters.  Red-tailed Hawks kept us awake averaging about 20 rph. A handful of Sharpshins, and a harrier rounded out the day. White-throated Swifts stayed around while the wind was nil in the 10-11 am hour, then quieted when the wind became a light NW breeze.  The Redtails started lining up to move when the wind flipped. <br/><br/>Great Thanksgiving gratitudes for the amazing GGRO community that comes together to conduct this annual pulse-taking of Pacific Raptor Flyway, counting and banding each fall now for four decades. <br/><br/>- Allen Fish <br/><br/>Dayleaders: John Davis, Allen Fish <br/><br/>Count Team: Mitch Green, Patricia Contaxis, Susan Greef <br/>

<p>What a day to end off Wednesday's 1 team of Hawkwatch! Although raptor activity was not buzzing throughout the day, we nonetheless saw spectacular birds flying through, making us all turn our heads in excitement and joy. The day started off with nice, classic November temperatures, keeping us bundled but not freezing. It was great having the skies littered with clouds all around as it gave the team a great contrast for spotting raptors. We had a steady stream of Red-tailed Hawks coming from the west flying toward Golden Gate Bridge, with a bundle of juveniles and adults. Other notable mentions were a zipping dark Merlin and a few early morning Peregrines keeping us hyper-fixated. Overall it was an amazing day on the hill!

<p>Our final Tuesday 1 Hawkwatch for the 2023 season can be described in three words: crisp, sentimental, and epic. We counted our last hawks under mostly cloudy skies, buffeted against gusty autumnal November winds and air temperatures in the high 50 degrees F. Despite declining raptor numbers typical of late-season migration, we still enjoyed watching multiple adult accipiters flitting and zipping around Hawk Hill, many Red-tailed Hawks both distant and far, as well as our pair of adult Peregrine Falcons seen frequently throughout the season. If all of this isn't considered epic enough, our hawkwatching expectations were blown out of the water in the early afternoon. A few of our counters observed a buteo flying in the north quadrant that looked... "different", and quickly asked other hawkwatchers to get their eyes on it for a faster identification! Within moments, yelps and cheers could be heard all the way from the platform because a Rough-legged Hawk was in our midst!! This second Roughie of the season was alternating between stilling and gliding west, giving hawkwatchers plenty of time to "ooh" and "aah" and orient it in their scopes.  <br/> <br/>Seeing a Roughie certainly provided excitement reflective of our team's vibe throughout the season! However, Roughie or not, our Tuesday 1 team had a great day in each other's company and are already missing our bi-weekly time together.

<p>Hey everyone! We had a good day! This should be no surprise, as it's always a good day when you're out hawk-watching with the GGRO. However, today was just a touch more magical than other days. As some of you might know, we are in the final stretch of the fall migration monitoring season with only two more weeks left. Oh, how time flies by! The Monday 1 team was greeted on the hill with impeccable weather; crystal clear skies and a brisk breeze kept us energized throughout the day. From the moment we started counting, we had a slow but steady stream of birds flying through the Headlands, mainly consisting of Red-tailed Hawks. Around noon, Hawkwatchers spotted a subadult Golden Eagle as it drifted around Kirby Cove! Not only that, but about an hour later we saw a juvenile Bald Eagle rise from the very same location! Everyone on the hill was able to get a close look at these two amazing species before they flew off towards San Francisco and beyond. The Monday 1 Hawkwatch team was satisfied by the incredible bird observations along with the great company on the hill. For the rest of the teams, we wish you good luck!  <br/><br/>-Juan Esparza <br/><br/>Dayleader: Deborah Crooks <br/><br/>Count Team: Linda Schneider, Denise Peck, Keith Gress, Mary Malec, Krista Fanucchi, Juan Esparza <br/>

<p>Today was a typical late season day on Hawk Hill. Frigid winds from the north made the morning feel colder than 59 degrees F, but thankfully the winds died down early on and we experienced pleasant weather for the rest of the day. Raptor activity continues to dissipate as winter slowly descends upon us. Despite the emptier skies, we spotted a couple of Red-shouldered Hawks, some Northern Harriers, and two last-minute Merlins. One of those Merlins decided to stick around for longer than usual and we got to watch as it plucked a few unsuspecting insects out of the sky.

<p>11/17/23 - Friday 2 <br/><br/>Another interesting weather day in the Marin Headlands! Despite rain forecasted for the early afternoon, our Friday 2 team started counting at 10 a.m. amidst overcast skies mixed with sun, good visibility, gusty winds from the northeast, and moderate temperatures in the high 60 degrees F. Following similar trends as of late, the skies were sparser with raptors compared to peak-weeks-past. However, this allowed hawkwatchers ample time to observe some beautiful hawks! Adult Red-tailed Hawks were seen consistently throughout the day- often dropping their feet and stooping on one another in what looked like either a playful or territorial fashion. We also watched a juvenile Peregrine Falcon swooping around the hill as well as a dark morph juvenile Red-tail.  <br/><br/>As promised, dark rainclouds started to move in from the south slightly before 2 p.m., signaling an early end to the day.

<p>It's been a week of dramatic skies, textured clouds, and the looming promise of rain - which began to fall softly on our heads near the end of the day. Today was a bit chilly, with temperatures in the high 50s and a consistent 8-12mph wind from the north. Rain started to fall over the ocean, with the front moving steadily north until it reached us and ended the count a half-hour early. The bulk of today's numbers were made up of Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks, with a smattering of Sharp-shinned Hawks and a lone adult male Northern Harrier close to the end of the day. A beautiful day under moody skies, despite the relatively low late-season numbers.  <br/><br/>- Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleader: Christine Cariño <br/><br/>Count Team: John Davis, Patricia Contaxis, Lydia Bruno, Laura Echávez, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<p>With the threat of rain on the horizon, we weren't sure how long we'd get to count today; but luckily the rain stayed away all day and we witnessed some marvelous clouds throughout our time on the hill. Temperatures ranged from 57-65 degrees F with varying winds from the east; a crisp chill in the air reminding us of the change in season.  Our morning was full of action, with a pair of territorial adult Peregrine Falcons making dives on several Red-tailed Hawks and a Sharp-shinned Hawk. The high-octane thrills continued with a pair of adult Redtails chasing off a juvenile Redtail over the channel. Although the afternoon was slower, we still enjoyed looks at a closely perched adult Redtail (with a visible band!) and an adult male Northern Harrier. Despite lower raptor numbers at this time of year, we can still see some amazing raptor behaviors!  <br/><br/>- Isabella Plummer <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Don Bartling, Catherine Elliot <br/><br/>Count Team: Stefanie Arthur, Tom Luster, Wing Ng, Allen Fish, Isabella Plummer <br/>

<p>Luck smiled upon us today with the weather. The entire team expected to have been rained out of the hill, but we played it by ear and boy did it pay off. The skies were littered with beautiful formations of clouds, all hit with a lovely glow of light from the sun. The air was clear and crisp, allowing us to see as far down as San Jose! With great conditions to start off our day, we got right to counting. Like the last few days though, raptor numbers have been dwindling. Most of the day was filled with empty skies, with not too many Turkey Vultures to be seen either. With the slowdown, Tuesday's 2 team still kept their sharp eyes out for anything that may have been out there. Toward the end of the count, we were visited by an amazing adult male Northern Harrier! He kept us company for a while before disappearing into the north. With the forecast predicting rain for the next few days, we can only wish the same luck we had with the weather for tomorrow's team.

<p>We continue to enjoy the late-season crispness in the air that brings stellar visibility all around Hawk Hill. The day started at a pleasant 66-degrees F and a mild 8-mph breeze from the east. As the day warmed up, wispy clouds were accompanied by a still whisper of wind, but we closed the day with a steady 10-mph gust from the west at a cool 63-degrees F. <br/><br/>Perhaps due to the coming rain, today's flight was slower than the last couple of days. However, years of GGRO Hawkwatch data suggest that we are in the middle of the second peak in Red-tailed Hawk sightings, and we indeed saw a decent number of Redtails! A few accipiters still trickled through, including a couple of adult Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks. At around 1:30PM, a large M-shaped raptor rose over Rodeo Lagoon, its long wings held perfectly bowed. The entire team excitedly turned to the west to admire the adult Osprey as it steadily made its way over the Golden Gate. <br/><br/>-Laura Echávez, GGRO Biotech <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Rod Santos <br/><br/>Count Team: Laura Coatney, Alex Cox, Parker Holzman Smith, Holly Thomas, Allen Fish, Laura Echávez <br/>

<p>We had a warm and sunny day with excellent visibility on Hawk Hill- a perfect recipe for hawkwatching! Despite little-to-no wind throughout the day, there was a steady stream of mostly high-flying Red-tailed Hawks in what appeared to be a distinct line of migration coming from the northwest. It's always a treat to watch migration in real time!  <br/> <br/>The day would not have been complete without a couple instances of bird drama! Amongst one of the many kettles of Red-tails there was a mysterious hybrid buteo with carpal marks like a Rough-legged Hawk but a tail pattern closer to a juvenile Red-tail. This closely resembled a buteo that was near Hawk Hill on October 26th and captured on video by volunteer Wing Ng. Additionally, a distant adult Golden Eagle was identified after much deliberation between hawkwatchers; making for a very exciting day! <br/> <br/>-Clare SantaColoma <br/> <br/>Dayleaders: Brian O'Laughlin, Mary Malec <br/> <br/>Count Team: Jeff Boissier, JJ Harris, Melissa Hero, Krista Fanucchi, Clare SantaColoma <br/>

<p>The light is beautiful these days, as the season begins to wind down and the shadows grow longer. The sun hangs low in the sky, adding an element of challenge to hawkwatching just as it enriches the earth tones of the landscape and the plumage of passing raptors. Today's conditions were mild, with a light breeze for most of the day that began from the east before shifting to the northwest later in the afternoon. Temperatures remained in the mid 60s to low 70s. A beautiful patchwork of clouds drifted slowly overhead, filtering the light as the sun charted its course along the horizon.  <br/><br/>We had a particularly high count of Turkey Vultures today compared to recent weeks, as well as a steady flow of Red-tailed Hawks. One juvenile Ferruginous Hawk sailed high overhead, along with handfuls of late-season accipiters.

<p>Our Thursday 1 team enjoyed a pleasantly typical November day on the hill! Little-to-no wind coupled with the tail-end of fall migration made for fewer raptor sightings. However, mostly cloudy skies mixed with sun and air temperatures in the low 60 degrees F created a brisk but comfortable hawkwatching atmosphere! Despite lower numbers of raptors than of the past few weeks, our team still got wonderful views of both near and far birds! Arguably the most exciting 15 minutes of today rivaled any sightings of peak-days-past: first, an adult Bald Eagle was spotted soaring over the ocean near Lands' End, giving onlookers a show with or without binoculars. During this experience, hawkwatchers were quickly pulled in the opposite direction to gaze at a subadult Bald Eagle simultaneously flying near Slacker Hill which provided a great contrast to the differences in plumage between the two. Lastly, another adult Bald Eagle was spotted flying distantly in the north, bringing today's Bald Eagle count to a final total of three! <br/> <br/>-Clare SantaColoma <br/> <br/>Dayleader: John Davis, Allen Fish<br/> <br/>Count Team: Arden Bucklin-Sporer, Bob Blumberg, Susan Greef, Krista Fanucchi, Clare SantaColoma <br/>

<p>We're nearing the end of the season folks! With that comes a great variety of species flying through along with an uptick of adult raptors, primarily Red-tailed Hawks. This will be the second to last day for Wednesday's 1 team, and knowing the end is near, everyone was as eager as ever to count for the day and see some amazing birds. We started the morning with a brisk autumn breeze from the northeast to keep us layered up, although there were intermittent moments where the sun beating down on us kept us toasty and shaved off a few jackets. Activity is not the same as it was during early October, but we had some interesting birds fly through nonetheless! With the shift in time from daylight savings, the low light keeps us on our toes with raptor identification, but not enough to stump this team. The bulk of the birds seen today were adult Red-tails, with some amazing pass-bys from Merlins, Sharp-shinned Hawks, and even a juvenile Bald Eagle! We're hoping tomorrow's team will also get the chance to spot some great raptors.

<p>After 3 cycles in a row of relentless fog-watching, our Tuesday 1 team was finally able to make it up to the hill for a full day of counting! In full-blown autumn fashion, our count was conducted with mostly blue skies, mild breezes from the NW, and temperatures in the high 50s to low 60s degrees F throughout the day.  <br/> <br/>The morning started on an exciting note with a flurry of Northern Harrier activity! While a few hawkwatchers had their sights set on an adult female Harrier (rare for the Headlands, as they account for only about 4% of sightings on Hawkwatch), other team members were watching a high-speed Harrier chase! A raven was relentlessly chasing after a juvenile Harrier for enough time that hawkwatchers were afforded a good glimpse of the action.  <br/> <br/>Some other notable sightings throughout the day included more adult and juvenile Red-tailed Hawks with a wide variety of plumages, as well as a Common Raven that whizzed back and forth the hill with a snake in its bill! <br/> <br/> -Clare SantaColoma <br/> <br/>Dayleader: Andy Bradshaw <br/> <br/>Count Team: Chris Tarr, Jody Newman, Rich Eliason, Woody Woodbury, Carmen DeLeon, Isabella Plummer, Clare SantaColoma <br/>

<p>An eventful, warm day for the Friday 2 Hawkwatch crew! As temperatures increased throughout the day, the flight got both higher and further away from the hill. With little to no wind, Red-tailed Hawks stacked up along Slacker ridge and gained lift easily in the thermals.  <br/><br/>A Swainson's Hawk, with its slim pointed wings, was spotted near Mt. Tam before it drifted right above Hawk Hill and beyond. Another less common sighting from Hawk Hill, a Ferruginous Hawk, was observed teetering slightly as it flew close to the hillside by Slacker ridge.

<p>Today the smell of pizza was wafting through the air, and... wait, what is that bird? Could it be? Yes, that is a juvenile Rough-legged Hawk coming straight for the hill! Circling once, twice, three times, showing off its big dark belly band and carpal patches, and peering down at us wondering what all the commotion was about. Hawkwatchers scrambling for the scopes, jumping up and down and exclaiming - the very image of celebration. This bird graced us with a good, long look while it circled languidly overhead before drifting south toward the Golden Gate. Little did it know that its long journey from the Arctic north would end up conjuring such joy on the ground below. <br/><br/>Conditions today were warm, mostly sunny, and windless, which made the hill feel much hotter than the recorded air temperature of about 70 degrees F. Red-tailed Hawk numbers are still relatively high, and today we got good views of several dark-morph birds, including one remarkably charcoal-colored adult Redtail. Another notable sighting was a late-season Osprey that flew through in the morning - overall, a very exciting day!  <br/><br/>Dayleader: Christine Cariño <br/><br/>Count Team: John Davis, Patricia Contaxis, Lydia Bruno, Holly Thomas, Laura Echávez, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<p>Happy Hawkwatch Halloween all you raptor aficionados and avid blog readers! We're lucky the hawks don't dress up as other species today to fool us (except perhaps those eminent tricksters, the shapeshifting ravens). Our morning started under wispy clouds with a gusty east wind, which kept temperatures cool until the breeze ceased rather suddenly in the mid-afternoon, and we ended the day with our layers shed. <br/><br/>The steady flow of Red-tailed Hawks continues, although numbers dropped today from their recent peak over the weekend. We've also seen a slight pickup in the number of Northern Harrier sightings this week, with today making the highest count so far this season - we can only hope the trend continues upward. Throughout the morning, we watched a pair of adult Peregrine Falcons rise from Kirby Cove now and then to harass other raptors passing through. One of these pugnacious peregrines even stooped at a Red-tail, making contact and knocking a few feathers loose before the hawk took the hint and exited the falcon's airspace. All trick, no treat - how rude.  <br/><br/>- Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Horacio Mena, Pat Bacchetti <br/><br/>Count team: Dan Foldes, Woody Woodbury, Maureen Grabowski, Dennis Davison, Mary Kenney, Holly Thomas, Allen Fish, Juan Esparza, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<p>Happy Monday! After a bit of a blustery start, Hawk Hill experienced pleasant weather for most of the day, with temperatures up to 68 degrees F and great visibility in all directions. We had a steady flow of birds throughout the day, the majority of which were Red-tailed Hawks of all ages and morphs. The adult accipiters also really put on a show, giving us some close views of their slaty blue backs as they zoomed by. Perhaps the rarest sighting of the day was an adult female Northern Harrier. Adult female Harriers make up the smallest percentage of Harrier sightings on Hawk Hill so we were very excited to see her! <br/><br/>-Isabella Plummer <br/><br/>Dayleader: Linda Schneider <br/><br/>Count Team: Roy Pisetsky, Deborah Crooks, Peter Sapienza, Denise Peck, Allen Fish, Krista Fanucchi, Laura Echávez, Isabella Plummer <br/>

<p>The Sunday 1 team had a fantastic day of counting raptors up on Hawk Hill! These past few mornings have been brisk and chilly, so we came prepared with many layers of sweaters, hoodies, puffers! Skies were clear and warm winds came from the southeast. Before the start of the count, a White-tailed Kite flew low in the valley and slowly meandered towards Slacker Ridge for several minutes! This rare sight foreshadowed the great day we would have.  <br/><br/>The second sighting of the day was of two adult Peregrine Falcons effortlessly gliding around the coastal ridges. Our team was also amazed by the sheer number of Red-tailed Hawks passing through throughout the day. However, an even more unusual buteo graced us with its presence -an adult Ferruginous Hawk. It circled no more than 100 feet over the team, looking down at the spectating hawkwatchers. <br/><br/>We were also visited by a very energetic group of young birdwatchers, all members of the Junior Raptor Society eagerly spotting birds and curious about the GGRO's Hawkwatch program. It was great to have the team share their knowledge and impart curiosity on those who someday may join us on the hill to count birds as well! We ended the day having filled our hearts with so many species and fantastic moments and are looking forward to the next time we can do all this again! <br/><br/> <br/><br/>-Juan Esparza <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Sam Hontalas, Rod Santos <br/><br/>Count Team: Laura Coatney, Melissa Kohner, Parker Holzman Smith, Mona Broukhim, Laura Echávez, Juan Esparza <br/>

<p>An eventful day for hawkwatchers out on the hill! Our Saturday 1 team spent the day counting raptors with clear blue skies, distant haze, mild-moderate wind gusts mostly from the northeast, and comfortable temperatures in the low-mid 60 degrees F. Following historical migration patterns in the Marin Headlands, we have recently been seeing a second peak of both juvenile and adult Red-tailed Hawks passing through! Today was no different, with a steady flow of Red-tails forming distant kettles over Mt. Tam, Bolinas Ridge and the FM towers, as they made their way over Hawk Hill and beyond. This included a higher proportion of dark morph juveniles! Also of note, the second Swainson's Hawk of the season was spotted over Rodeo Lagoon and made its way directly over the hill, leaving our team awestruck!  <br/><br/>It was a very pleasant day to be a hawkwatcher! We're looking forward to seeing more adult accipiter activity, Red-tailed Hawks, and to spot that Rough-legged Hawk before the season concludes! <br/><br/>-Clare SantaColoma  <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Brian O'Laughlin, Mary Malec <br/><br/>Count Team: JJ Harris, Jeff Boissier, Melissa Hero, Rina Kor, Carole Garrett, Krista Fanucchi, Clare SantaColoma <br/>

<h2><a name='20231027'/>Friday, October 27, 2023</h2>
<p>Our Friday began with a few auspicious birds, even before the count officially started - an adult male Northern Harrier, an American Kestrel, and a Peregrine Falcon were all spotted from the parking lot below Hawk Hill! Given the crystal-clear skies and light breeze, things seemed to be looking up.  <br/><br/>Our optimism turned out to be well-warranted, as it unfolded into a beautifully crisp autumn day on the hill with some exciting raptor diversity. Temperatures stayed in the high 50s to low 60s, with a light breeze from the south shifting to the west later in the afternoon. Broad-winged Hawks are back on the board after a week with no sightings, including a rare dark-morph adult bird - hopefully these late-comers are on track to reunite with their friends further south! We also spotted both eagle species, with a far-off Golden Eagle and two Bald Eagles that passed closer by the hill. And finally, we caught a glimpse of an adult Ferruginous Hawk making its lonesome way along a distant ridgeline. Aside from these relative rarities, our Red-tailed Hawk sightings are climbing steadily back up as we enter the second red-tail peak of the season. There are still many more to come, as the days grow steadily shorter and the hawks reach their destinations to settle in for the winter, one by one. <br/><br/>- Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Holly Thomas, Michaela Figari <br/><br/>Count Team: Linda Sudduth, Yvette MacDonald, Sonja Raub, Courtney Buechert, Nick Yatsko, Laura Echávez, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<h2><a name='20231026'/>Thursday, October 26, 2023</h2>
<p>Today's blue skies, comfortable temperatures and mild wind definitely did not disappoint our Thursday 1 team! In true autumnal fashion, temperatures ranged from the high 50s to low 60s throughout the day, accompanied by a mostly gentle breeze that shifted in both direction and strength as the afternoon progressed. Despite being past peak migration, we still had a total of 267 raptor sightings that included an interesting variety of species and soap opera-esque drama! While most of the team had their eyes glued to an adult Bald Eagle soaring close to the hill, one hawkwatcher had her focus set on a stooping Peregrine Falcon instead. As she loudly announced that this fierce raptor was, in fact, stooping, it became clear that it was about to make contact with a Cooper's Hawk flying below. With one quick blow, the Coop's fate was sealed and began falling out of the sky like a "baseball wrapped in newspaper". If that wasn't cool enough, we also had the pleasure of two adult male Northern Harrier sightings (more famously known as "Gray Ghosts") flying above and below Hawk Hill at a relatively close distance. <br/><br/>It was a great day on the hill! Our team is looking forward to more raptor drama and to finally seeing that long-awaited Rough-legged Hawk before the season comes to an end. <br/><br/>-Clare SantaColoma <br/><br/>Dayleaders: John Davis, Allen Fish <br/><br/>Count Team: Bob Blumberg, Susan Greef, Patricia Contaxis, Arden Bucklin-Sporer, Mitch Green, Krista Fanucchi, Clare SantaColoma <br/>

<p>The realization of autumn is really beginning to hit us up on Hawk Hill. Aside from the uptick of people drinking pumpkin spice lattes and talking about carving pumpkins, Wednesday 1's team had a lot of luck and good chance at spotting some Northern Harriers today, with many juveniles displaying that pumpkin-colored chest. The other realization was of course with the weather. With the slightly dense cloud cover, temperatures stayed in the high 50s to low 60s, keeping the air frigid and our layers of clothing on. Though with the cold I'd like to believe that it kept us wide awake and sharp to spotting out the many raptors passing through the Headlands today! Aside from two great passes of some adult male Northern Harriers, many Merlins continued to make their way through, along with a few great stoop displays from some adult Peregrine Falcons. Red-tailed Hawks are beginning to show up in higher numbers again, with the majority being adults. We are grateful that the weather was cooperative today, knowing how fickle it could be. Until tomorrow to see what shows up on the hill!  <br/><br/>-Juan Esparza <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Gretchen Zantzinger, Jon Altemus <br/><br/>Count Team: Jan Ambrosini, Joan Duffield, Wing Ng, Allen Fish, Juan Esparza <br/>

<p>It's a good thing our Tuesday 1 team gets along so well because we have, for the third time in a row, spent the day chatting and birdwatching around Rodeo Lagoon rather than counting on Hawk Hill! Despite our fearless leaders and fellow staff and volunteers manifesting optimal hawkwatching conditions, Karl the Fog has proved persistent. However, we still had an enjoyable day in each other's company and are keeping all of our fingers and toes crossed that the next cycle brings some clear skies! In the meantime, we were able to get a close-up look at a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk perched in a eucalyptus tree and felt collective cute-aggression towards adorable songbirds like Pine Siskin and Pygmy Nuthatch. <br/><br/>-Clare SantaColoma <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Mary Kenney, Andy Bradshaw <br/><br/>Count Team: Chris Tarr, Jody Newman, Rich Eliason, Woody Woodbury, Paula Moser, Carmen DeLeon, Isabella Plummer, Clare SantaColoma <br/>

<p>What a day full of weather whiplash. Monday's team was welcomed to Hawk Hill with crystal clear skies, the blaring sun showering us with more warmth than anticipated. However, by 10:45 a distant fog began to thicken and crept slowly into the valley below us. A few minutes later, a monumental wall of dense mist reached us at the peak. We were quickly enveloped and soon surrounded by visibility no more than ten feet.  <br/><br/>The team decided to wait in the cold by huddling in conversation around the center platform. Sure enough, after an hour of chilly fog, the skies began to clear again! Throughout the day we counted the usual culprits, with a large uptick in adult accipiters. We also saw many Merlins zoom by the hill headed toward the city! Overall, we were pleased that we persevered through the always intimidating wall of fog and got to stay on the hill to see and count new birds flying through. As always, wishing tomorrow's team the best! Hopefully they'll get a glimpse of a species yet to be seen this season... <br/><br/>-Juan Esparza <br/><br/>Dayleader: Deborah Crooks <br/><br/>Count Team: Linda Schneider, Denise Peck, Keith Gress, Wade Eakle, Mary Malec, Krista Fanucchi, Juan Esparza <br/>

<p>Clear skies and perfect NW winds kept hawks moving around in the morning.  By 1 pm the fog started threatening, with some in and out action that made us appreciate the occasional long views of sun-lit Mt Diablo and the East Bay hills.<br/><br/>Avian highlights included watching an adult Peregrine corral some 800 Band-tailed Pigeons into a kind of moebius-donut flock with no beginning and no end - just above Kirby Cove.<br/><br/>A juvenile Northern Harrier made a big show of catching a mouse then contour-flying along the west side of Hawk Hill showing off the prey to either us or, perhaps to the two Ravens. The Ravens eventually tail-chased the harrier and forced a drop of the mouse. Moral: don't show off. <br/><br/>Lots of great looks at adult accipiters; these year-old and older Sharpshins and Cooper's tend to show up more in October. And a fine look across the back of a close-flying, late-season adult Osprey.<br/><br/>Wonderful to have the Roving Ranger crew greeting the public on Conzelman Road today.

<p>In classic Marin Headlands fashion, today's cold and gusty hawkwatching conditions were a stark contrast to the heatwave of the last couple of days. Our Friday 2 team was greeted by dense fog upon first meeting in the Hawk Hill parking lot this morning, prompting us to migrate down to the old Marin Headlands visitor center. After conducting the morning meeting and enjoying a leisurely bird walk around Rodeo Lagoon, we returned to Hawk Hill cautiously optimistic that conditions had improved. Fortunately, the fog layer had risen enough to provide sufficient visibility for hawkwatching! We darned ourselves with extra layers of clothing and started counting at noon, with temperatures in the low- to mid- 50 degrees F and wind gusts between 10-20 mph.  <br/><br/>It was great we were able to count today or else we would have missed out on some action! It seemed like there was a never-ending train of Sharp-shinned Hawks whizzing in and out of the fog, captivating hawkwatcher's attention despite the cold conditions! A comparatively large proportion of these sharpies were adults, adding another dimension to the show. We were also lucky enough to see some Kestrels and Merlins as they zipped around the hill. <br/><br/>-Clare SantaColoma <br/><br/>Dayleader: Courtney Buechert <br/><br/>Count Team: Will Ludan, Tomas McKay, Chris Cruz, Paulette Sherry, Nick Yatsko, Krista Fanucchi, Clare SantaColoma <br/>

<p>It was a scorcher of a day on Hawk Hill, with morning temperatures starting at 77 degrees and climbing steadily throughout. In the afternoon our easterly wind shifted to a pleasant breeze from the west, bringing some ocean air and keeping temperatures from reaching the 90 degree cutoff. Regardless, it was a day that demanded fortitude and plenty of hydration. <br/><br/>The birds clearly felt the weather as well, and adapted their plans accordingly - numerous passerines, large flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons, and much of our raptor count passed the hill in the morning, slowing to a near trickle in the heat of the afternoon. The birds were high and far out, riding the shimmering heat of distant ridgelines. It ended up being a decent day for the Northern Harrier count, with five on the board after nearly a week without a documented sighting. Hopefully more will sail by soon. <br/><br/>- Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleader: Christine Cariño <br/><br/>Count Team: Jim Yampolsky, John Davis, Pauline Yeckley, Patricia Contaxis, Lydia Bruno, Allen Fish, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<p>Interesting fog dynamic up in the Marin Headlands today. Upon driving to the hill, the valley was inundated with dense fog until we reached the top of the hill, where the skies were clear and the sun breathed warmth down our backs. Perhaps a tad too warm. Though the weather was nonetheless perfect for Tuesday's 2 team as we started our day with temps hovering around 69 degrees F. Looking toward the south was a bit rough on the eyes with the sun beating light onto the fog, bouncing it back onto our fragile pupils and making us squint to search for raptors.  <br/><br/>We had some great close-up looks at a few Sharp-shinned Hawks and Cooper's Hawks throughout the day, with a few of them being adults! We also had a Broad-winged Hawk greet us as it circled in the north close to the hill. At around noon we even had a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk fly along Wolfback Ridge, it now being the 7th one seen for the season. Toward the end of the day, the fog had at that point dissipated, and a nice northwest wind kept us cool. Many more accipiters flew by, along with a few adult Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and some Red-shouldered Hawks. Overall it was a pretty great, steady day up on Hawkwatch for us!

<p>The fog inversion layer was low over the Golden Gate this morning, but the balmy temperatures quickly dissipated any moisture that lingered in the air. Although the weather ranged from 66 - 75 degrees F, the nonexistent wind and the glare over the bay kept the team warm. <br/><br/>Once the fog over the ocean cleared, we could see far beyond the Farallon Islands and birds flew high and low past the hawkwatch team, mostly Violet-green Swallows and Band-tailed Pigeons. However, we still had some exciting raptor sightings throughout the day. A young Broad-winged Hawk welcomed the team to the Hill; and later a couple of Peregrine Falcons chased each other over Kirby Cove before heading for the bridge. Just after noon, an elegant white bird appeared below Hill 88, soon followed by another -two White-tailed Kites fluidly gliding against the rolling hills! Lastly, the afternoon brought a bouquet of Merlins!

<p>Early this morning, Conzelman Road and Hawk Hill were wrapped in an ominous white velvet blanket, but that did not deter our team from summitting to the count site. Once there, we could see hints of blue starting to peek through the thin upper layer of fog. Our optimism was rewarded by a warm easterly 8-mph breeze that pushed the mist into an inversion and opened up a 360-degree view of the Bay Area. The wind disappeared in the afternoon, and despite the fog dancing in and out of the Golden Gate and the faint haze that hung low to the east, visibility remained high. <br/><br/>The peak of today's raptor activity (which was not much) happened between 12 and 1PM. A juvenile Broad-winged Hawk rose over Rodeo Valley and circled over the team for several minutes before heading south. A female American Kestrel circled high over Kirby Cove with a juvenile Sharp-shinned Hawk. Sprinkled between Sharpies, a handful of Cooper's Hawks also passed by in small flurries. In the late afternoon, as the feathery fog crept over Rodeo Lagoon, a speedy Merlin flew straight for Hawk Hill and dove into Kirby to dive on another Merlin! <br/><br/>Overall, a beautiful day on the hill.

<p>Our Saturday 1 team was welcomed with Hawkwatch-friendly conditions this morning and for most of the afternoon! The day began overcast with warm air and little-to-no wind, transitioning to partly sunny around 11 a.m. Despite sufficient visibility, the raptors were few and far between, leading hawkwatchers to wonder if peak numbers from the last couple of weeks are a thing of the past. Some highlights included a distant juvenile Broad-winged Hawk in west quadrant, a Cooper's Hawk in full adult plumage and a Kestrel! Dense fog swept in shortly before 2 p.m., leaving us with no choice but to stop counting and leave the hill an hour short. <br/><br/>Our team is looking forward to the slower part of migration season's silver lining- the possibility of seeing more adult raptors and a different variety of species in the next couple of cycles! <br/><br/>-Clare SantaColoma <br/><br/>Dayleader: Brian O'Laughlin, Mary Malec <br/><br/>Count Team: JJ Harris, Jeff Boissier, Melissa Hero, Carole Garrett <br/>

<p>Despite some vaguely threatening wisps of fog that began materializing as we started our day, the weather remained fair for this Friday's Hawkwatch team. Today continued our trend of fairly slow days on the hill, but no day is entirely without its charms.  <br/><br/>We spotted all four commonly seen falcon species when a lone Prairie Falcon sailed by in the afternoon, close enough for some great looks at its overall form and characteristic dark wingpits. Birds like this falcon, whose breeding and wintering habitats are so distinct from the coastal chaparral of the Golden Gate, always inspire the imagination and cause one to wonder where it began its journey, and what brought it all the way to the Pacific coast. Another good day on the hill, ever looking forward to what the next might bring. <br/><br/>- Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleader: Holly Thomas <br/><br/>Count Team: Laura Thomas, Yvette MacDonald, Sonja Raub, Courtney Buechert, Nick Yatsko, Laura Echávez, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<p>Clear skies and slight winds sent a slow but steady stream of raptors through the headlands today. Though the count was slightly slower, the observations remained lively and memorable. Low in the south quadrant, just above the glistening water, an adult Bald Eagle was spotted as it lifted to meet another Bald Eagle, this one a juvenile. Around noon, two adult Red-tailed Hawks and two Ravens were observed flying with a small, stocky bird with a noticeably stubby, fan-shaped tail; a Common Poorwill! Satisfied with the unique, fleeting observations from the count today, we Hawkwatchers are looking forward to the captivating moments yet to come. Always in good company...

<p>Finally! A break in the beautiful chaos of weather that sits up top of Hawk Hill. Our Wednesday 1 team was brimming with enthusiasm upon seeing clear skies and feeling a brisk breeze. After our quick morning meet-up, we went straight to counting. The skies were not particularly hustling and bustling, but a steady stream of the Red-tailed Hawks, Cooper's Hawks, and Turkey Vultures kept our eyes busy throughout the day. Aside from raptors, flocks of up to 100 Brown Pelicans were also making their way through the sky, making for stunning views of so many birds flying near one another. Toward the end of our day, the team witnessed a little tussle between two Peregrine Falcons in the west, with one stooping on the other and making its distinct "ee-chup" call. It was another great day for Hawkwatchers! We are all looking forward to another day to be up on the hill.  <br/><br/>-Juan Esparza <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Gretchen Zantzinger, Jon Altemus  <br/><br/>Count Team: Jan Ambrosini, Conner Cimmiyotti, Joan Duffield, Kimberlie Moutoux, Wing Ng, Allen Fish, Juan Esparza <br/>

<p>Our Tuesday 1 team tried their hardest to manifest decent visibility today, but Karl the Fog had other plans. Despite blue skies when we arrived at the parking lot, dense fog rolled in when we got up to the hill. This allowed us to take our time conducting the morning meeting and incorporated some extra education which included getting more familiar with using the GGRO scopes. Things were looking up shortly before noon when some of the fog cleared, encouraging us to start the count! We counted for a full hour between 12-1 p.m., with temperatures in the low 60 degrees F and mild winds coming from the west. After a total of 9 raptors were spotted, the dayleaders decided to call it at 1 p.m. due to fog. <br/><br/>-Clare SantaColoma <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Mary Kenney, Andy Bradshaw <br/><br/>Count Team: Chris Tarr, Jody Newman, Woody Woodbury, Paula Moser, Wing Ng, Denise Peck, Isabella Plummer, Carmen DeLeon <br/>

<p>Sunday 2 gave it their most valiant effort, but alas, the fog did us in today. We started our count at noon with optimism and ended the count just two hours later. Visibility was poor in all directions, though there were glimpses of Mount Diablo between fog swells. Temperatures were in the mid-60s, and wind speeds peaked at 17 miles per hour, making the north quadrant feel like the Arctic. We managed to steal a few longing glances at a couple Kestrels, a Merlin, a Red-tailed Hawk, and some Turkey Vultures, but it wasn't enough to keep us going.

<p>This is Day 3 of the heat wave. It was stifling and still. With no wind for respite nor clouds in the sky to sprinkle some shade, the team ended the count early when temps reached 87 degrees F. It is difficult to know everything that prompts raptor movement during migration, but perhaps the heat also affected the birds because the skies were somewhat quiet today. <br/><br/>To welcome us onto Hawk Hill, three juvenile Broad-winged Hawks circled over Slacker Hill for nearly 30 minutes. The theme of today's flight was far and few, however, notable sightings include a couple of adult Sharp-shinned Hawks, good views of a few juvenile Red-shouldered Hawks, and a couple of adult Peregrine Falcons catching ridge lift with a kettle of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures.

<p>It was a hot one out on Hawk Hill today, that's for sure! Temperatures started off around 80 degrees F when our Friday 2 team first arrived on the hill and continued to climb throughout the day. Factoring in the mild to non-existent breeze coming from the east and shadeless skies, we decided to pack up for the day at about 1 p.m. when temperatures reached 90 degrees F.

<p>It was a balmy day for the Hawkwatch crew -the warm temps fluctuated between the mid-70s to high 80s! The morning greeted us with easterly 20-mph gusts that turned still by 2:30pm when we left the hill early. Although today's sightings were nowhere near the last few days' numbers, the team had great opportunities at viewing accipiters up close. <br/><br/>We had a few flurries of Sharp-shinned Hawks and Cooper's Hawks early on, many of which arrived at eye level and circled the team before heading off across the Golden Gate. The Broad-winged Hawks also continued to pass through today, but they kept their distance as they emerged above far-away ridgelines. Sprinkled between the many observations of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures, were a handful of Red-shouldered Hawks and a Merlin. <br/><br/>Raptors were not the only species on the move today, however... Any movement prompts our team of Hawkwatchers to raise their binoculars, but today, they found many a Monarch Butterfly, multiple species of dragonflies, and even ballooning spiders moving across their field of view! Lastly, swifts and swallows, probably chasing after some of the winged insects, also crossed the bay in impressive numbers. <br/><br/>-Laura Echávez, GGRO Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Christine Cariño <br/><br/>Count Team: Lydia Bruno, Pat Contaxis, John Davis, Jim Yampolsky, Pauline Yeckley, Allen Fish, Laura Echávez<br/>

<p>More than anything else, today was a day of impressive kettles. Our morning started amidst dense fog, but the inveterate optimism of the group pulled us all to the top of Hawk Hill anyway. This proved a fortunate decision, for after we spent the first minutes of the day staring halfheartedly into the fog, we were rewarded with an inkling of what the day would bring - a group of fifteen Broad-winged Hawks, materializing from the mist and swirling around the hilltop in remarkably close quarters. <br/><br/>Not long after, the fog began to lift and the sky revealed itself at last. The rest of the morning proved to be a wonderful opportunity to witness large kettles of raptors and practice identifying the species within. This remained a theme of the day, although the largest kettles seemed to form primarily during the first hours of the count after the fog cleared and the weather warmed. It was a great day for the Broadies with our highest daily count for the season so far, and we were lucky enough to see a Peregrine Falcon catch and eat a dragonfly mid-air. Overall, today showcased the remarkable potential of migration over Hawk Hill, and serves as an inspiring example of why we keep coming back - day after day, year after year.  <br/><br/>- Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Horacio Mena, Pat Bacchetti <br/><br/>Count Team: Woody Woodbury, Maureen Grabowski, Mary Kenney, Holly Thomas, Deborah Crooks, Wing Ng, Allen Fish, Juan Esparza, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<p>Alright folks, we've got Accipiters flying in by the droves! The Sunday 1 team arrived at the hill with clouds decorating the skies, blocking most of the sun until about noon when blue skies surrounded us. As soon as we started our count, the team was off, calling birds left and right. The skies were primarily filled with Sharp-shinned Hawks and Turkey Vultures, but a few other amazing birds also made appearances. Three White-tailed Kites flew past the hill rapidly; a Ferruginous Hawk was picked out from the direction of Mount Tamalpais; and two Broad-winged Hawks flew close to the hill before booking it south! Toward the end of the day, a looming sea of fog started to creep up onto the hill, obstructing our views completely for the last half hour. We stayed until the end, still able to call out a few Accipiters as they weaved in and out of the fog. <br/><br/>It was a great time up on the hill for other hawk aficionados as well! We also want to say a special thanks to the Feminist Bird Club of Sonoma, the Golden Gate Bird Alliance, and the San Joaquin Audubon Society for joining us today up on Hawk Hill and reveling in all the action we got to see today.

<p>Our Saturday 1 team enjoyed an ideal day on Hawk Hill! Slightly overcast skies mixed with sunshine greeted us this morning and persisted throughout the early afternoon, with sun dominating the sky between 1:30-3:00 p.m. There was a noticeably steady flight path of migration from the northwest heading over the bay, with raptors mostly flying high and continuing south. But like previous days, plenty of accipiters were spotted whizzing close to the hill, presumably on the lookout for prey. At one point, hawkwatchers got an up-close look at a juvenile Cooper's Hawk harassing a juvenile Peregrine Falcon in flight! More noteworthy sightings included a subadult Bald Eagle spotted over Slacker Ridge, exhibiting symmetrical primary wing molt (feather growth) as well as multiple juvenile Northern Harriers flying close to the hill before continuing their migration journey! <br/><br/>It was a great day to observe raptor migration in real time!

<p>The fog played a cruel trick on us this morning, when it materialized out of thin air just as we reached the top of Hawk Hill. It was clear and warm until about 9:30 a.m., but some days the weather simply has other plans. We remained on the hill for a while hopeful that the sun would overcome the drear, but when the Golden Gate Bridge foghorn sounded off its first morale-crushing blast, the team let out a collective groan and started packing up.  <br/><br/>We descended partway down the hill to the "Annex", wondering if we'd get clearer views to the south from underneath the fog layer, but conditions were unfortunately similar. For the final hour before 1 p.m. we ventured back up to Hawk Hill under a persistent spell of optimism, but the fog was ever thickening and our time on the hill ran out.  <br/><br/>Despite this unfortunate turn of events, the team made some notable, albeit unofficial sightings on and around the hill. We watched two Sharp-shinned Hawks wheel and dive on each other in and out of the mist, and a male American Kestrel perch on a fencepost near the top of the hill. The Common Raven pair, always in attendance, watched us in their glossy new coats. No strangers to fog and wind, who can say whether their spirits are dampened? <br/><br/>- Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Michaela Figari, Holly Thomas <br/><br/>Count Team: Linda Sudduth, Yvette MacDonald, Sonja Raub, Courtney Buechert, Nick Yatsko, Laura Echávez, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<p>Our Thursday 1 team enjoyed a beautiful day on Hawk Hill, filled with mostly blue skies, visiting day leaders and volunteers from other teams, balmy temperatures with mild-moderate winds mostly from the northwest, and most importantly- an abundance of raptors! We saw a bounty of the usual suspects- Cooper's, Sharp-shinned and Red-tailed Hawks, flying both high above and down below the hill. Some falcons decided to make appearances as well, such as a few Peregrines, American Kestrels and two Merlins. Around 12:30 this afternoon, a beautiful hawk with long, tapered wings and a white tail flew almost a full 360 degrees around Hawk Hill, leaving hawkwatchers rubbing their eyes and doing double takes. It was a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk! As if sightings for the day couldn't get any better, a White-tailed Kite was also spotted flying relatively close to the west quadrant, giving onlookers a clear view of itself from all angles. Finally, a dark morph juvenile Ferruginous Hawk was seen flying from the north quadrant, making its way along Slacker Ridge and ultimately kettling with a few Red-tails over Angel Island.  <br/><br/>Our team left feeling rejuvenated from our exciting day, sweetened by the fact that this was our first opportunity to HawkWatch together due to persistent fog on all our previous days!  <br/><br/>-Clare SantaColoma <br/><br/>Dayleader: John Davis <br/><br/>Count Team: Bob Blumberg, Susan Greef, Patricia Contaxis, Arden Bucklin-Sporer, Krista Fanucchi, Clare SantaColoma, Keith Gress, Gretchen Zantzinger, Wing Ng, Holly Thomas <br/>

<p>We've got birds folks! Lots of great activity today up on Hawk Hill for Wednesday 1 team. Unlike yesterday's fog-in day, our day was greeted with clear skies and warm air. We quickly got to starting our count with a few raptors passing by in the morning, but by noon, boy, the sky was booming with birds of all types! At one point, we were able to pick out a Red-shouldered Hawk, a Northern Harrier, a Red-tailed Hawk, and our first Golden Eagle all in the same line of view. Some other noteworthy action from the day was when a banded juvenile Red-tailed Hawk stooped right in front of the Hawkwatchers and displayed a very tasty-looking snake, along with some in-flight Peregrine battles with Mt. Tamalpais in the backdrop. Toward the end of our day, we lucked out and saw a White-tailed Kite pass by underneath Golden Gate Bridge headed past Kirby Cove!  <br/><br/>Along with great birds, we were also visited by some amazing groups up on the hill who heard GGRO talks about raptors and the key fieldmarks to identify them. It's always great to see people who want to learn more and share an appreciation for the raptors that fill the local skies. Thanks to the Marin Audubon Society, the University of San Francisco Ornithology class, and the Yale Blue Green Alumni Association for joining us and spending time with us on Hawk Hill! <br/><br/>- Juan Esparza <br/><br/>Dayleader: Gretchen Zantzinger <br/><br/>Count Team: Conner Cimmiyotti, Joan Duffield, Kimberlie Moutoux, Wing Ng, John Davis, Allen Fish, Juan Esparza <br/>

<p>Another strange weather day up on Hawk Hill! The Tuesday 1 team decided to conduct our morning meeting and educational presentation to volunteers up on the hill, despite the ever-present fog surrounding us. A photographer was snapping shots of Hawkwatchers in action alongside a Media & Communications Specialist at the GGNPC to capture "A Day in the Life of a GGRO Hawkwatcher." We had to officially call off the count at 1 p.m. due to the fog, but most of the Hawkwatchers stayed around just in case it cleared up--which it did (for a bit)! We caught a flurry of accipiters between the clouds, as well as Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures here and there! The Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy staff from Park Projects, Conservation & Community Science, and Youth Programs also happened to be visiting the hill to share updates on various projects and learn more about GGRO. We were lucky enough to have a recently banded adult Red-tailed Hawk released from the Wingspan platform for all to see. Glad we were able to still have some excitement on another fogged-out day!<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Mary Kenney, Andy Bradshaw<br/><br/>Count Team: Chris Tarr, Jody Newman, Rich Eliason, Woody Woodbury, Paula Moser, Carmen DeLeon, Clare SantaColoma, Isabella Plummer<br/><br/>

<p>Peculiar days are upon us, with today being no exception. All of you who follow our blog are probably well-acquainted with our Hawkwatch trends, and based on our data we expect flurries of raptors (particularly accipiters) in the coming days! Yet today caught us off guard with how eerily slow it was. It was as though we were back at the start of the season when the migration had just begun. Fortunately, we did have crystal clear skies and lovely weather all around as we counted the few raptors that came by. <br/><br/>Winds began to pick up around noon, and it was around then we were graced with an uncommon sighting of a White-tailed Kite! Throughout the day we saw groups of Turkey Vultures and just a few accipiters, with only one Cooper's Hawk sighting. Our team today was vigilant in finding raptors, ready for the droves of raptors to pass by us. Until next time!   <br/><br/>- Juan Esparza <br/><br/>Dayleader: Deborah Crooks <br/><br/>Count Team: Linda Schneider, Denise Peck, Keith Gress, Wade Eakle, Mary Malec, Krista Fanucchi, Juan Esparza <br/>

<p>Today's numbers may not have been as flashy as the last few days, but the Sunday 2 team still managed to pick up a few exciting sightings! Early on, we witnessed the aerial agility of a Peregrine Falcon as it dove on a flock of Band-tailed Pigeons. We later got a close view of a Peregrine heckling a Turkey Vulture and Cooper's Hawk. Today was also the first day we had a greater number of Cooper's Hawks than Sharp-shinned Hawks, but we'll see if this trend continues. The day started out with minimal wind from the west and good visibility all around, despite some lingering haze. Temperatures rose from low 60's to low 70's by the end of the day. Despite less activity in the sky, we had quite a few human visitors to the hill. We were happy to have birded alongside folks from the Monterey Audubon Society, Sonoma County Feminist Bird Club, and College of Marin.

<p>The haze thinned somewhat today, and high clouds gave way to bright sunshine to reward our Saturday 2 team with a pleasant day of hawkwatching on the hill. Numbers were down a bit from the previous two days but still high, as were the birds. Hawks soared high on thermals, making it a great day to practice identification from great distances. Red-tailed Hawk and accipiter numbers are still high as we make our way through peak season, and a dark morph Broad-winged Hawk was courteous enough to give us some great looks as it passed slowly overhead. <br/><br/>The hill was also abuzz with visitors today, drawing birders from all over the area to witness the raptor migration. It was great to see a sense of community forming on the hill amongst fellow birders of various ages and backgrounds.

<p>Peak migration is here, folks, and the accipiters and Broad-winged Hawks have certainly gotten the memo! Due to questionable air quality this morning, our Friday 2 team decided to closely monitor particulate levels throughout the day and check in with our teammates while HawkWatching. Fortunately, the gentle southwesterly winds between 1-5 m.p.h. began to slowly push the smoky air out and increase visibility as the day progressed! The team was counting in a comfortable low-mid 60 degrees F with mostly blue skies. As we began setting up, accipiters and at least 14 Broad-winged Hawks were forming kettles and flying high overhead, prompting a sense of urgency to finish our morning meeting and start HawkWatching! To highlight a few, we formally recorded 296 accipiters, 52 Broadies, and 10 Red-shouldered Hawk sightings by the end of the day. <br/><br/>Friday 2 had a great day on the hill and we're so excited to see what the next cycle brings!  <br/><br/>-Clare SantaColoma <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Libby Rouan, Courtney Buechert <br/><br/>Count Team: Tomas McKay, Nick Yatsko, Krista Fanucchi, Clare SantaColoma <br/>

<p>It was a very exciting day on Hawk Hill, with raptors coming through fast and furious all day long! On top of that, the sun (something of a rarity these past weeks!) was shining from the moment we arrived in the morning to the end of the day, accompanied by a light southerly breeze that rarely exceeded 10 miles per hour. Haze from the northern wildfires limited visibility slightly, but it remained fairly clear throughout the day, and temperatures were pleasant in the mid 60s.  <br/><br/>Today was our highest count day so far, with 617 birds counted at a rate of 123.4 hawks per hour! It was also our highest count day for a number of species: Sharp-shinned Hawks, Cooper's Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, Red-shouldered Hawks, Osprey, and Merlins all made great showings today. We had some great, close views of several American Kestrels and Merlins as they careened past the hill on their journeys south.  <br/><br/>- Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleader: John Davis <br/><br/>Count Team: Jim Yampolsky, Pauline Yeckley, Lydia Bruno, Holly Thomas, Michaela Figari, Wing Ng, Laura Echávez, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<p>Smoke from the northern fires continued to impact the air quality today, but not enough to ruin a wonderful hawkwatch day! Temperatures stayed in the mid to high 60's all day with winds between 3 to 7 miles per hour from the west. Visibility was poorer than usual due to the haze, but we still spotted plenty of birds. It was a falcon-filled day, with several sightings of female and male American Kestrels, adult Peregrine Falcons, and a few Merlins. We also had our highest count of the season for Broad-winged Hawks at 8 sightings. The Sharp-shinned Hawks outshined the Cooper's Hawks today, giving us several close passes to really check out those field marks.

<p>Migration is well and truly underway here at Hawk Hill! This morning the fog seemed reluctant to release its grasp on the top of the hill, but partway through our morning meeting it lifted to reveal scores of accipiters flying above and around us. The meeting took on a slightly frantic pace as our expectations for the day lifted suddenly along with the last of the fog, and we summited the hill to begin the count at 10:15 a.m.  <br/><br/>Conditions were mild, with a breeze between 7 and 12 mph from the west, and temperatures warming from 59 degrees to 69 degrees as the sun shone through a thin veil of clouds. Unfortunately, the team quickly realized that we were facing into a different, though no less detrimental atmospheric condition - smoke. We counted until 2 p.m., when the decision was made to end the day due to high AQI levels. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, it was a busy day on the hill with 325 total sightings at a rate of 81.3 hawks per hour. Almost half of the count today was Sharp-shinned Hawks, often appearing in the sky in small groups along with their larger cousin the Cooper's Hawk. Other highlights included 7 Merlins and a dark morph Broad-winged Hawk! Exciting to see the migration accelerating to full swing, and hopefully the haze won't stick around for long. <br/><br/>- Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Horacio Mena, Pat Bacchetti <br/><br/>Count Team: Dan Foldes, Maureen Grabowski, Dennis Davison, Mary Kenney, Oliver Chesley, Juan Esparza <br/>

<p>After a week of fog-outs, the Monday 2 team was lucky enough to be treated with good weather on Hawk Hill today. We started out with moderate visibility and lots of cloud cover. Temperatures were around 63 degrees and winds were between three to seven miles per hour from the south. As the day progressed, the skies cleared up with temperatures getting to 66 degrees and winds up to 15 miles per hour from the west. We even had a look at the Farallon Islands for a bit! <br/><br/>The accipiters were the stars of the show today, with a total of 85 Sharp-shinned Hawks and 61 Cooper's Hawks. Other notable sightings include some Northern Harriers, a Merlin, a couple Broad-winged Hawks, and one Monarch Butterfly.

<p>Have you noticed how obsessive birders can be about the weather yet? Specifically Hawkwatchers. For the sixth consecutive day, our hearts have been played with by the fog. All hope of a clear morning for counting was diminished upon turning the bend onto Conzelman Road and seeing the fog, thick like custard, rolling slowly through the hill. It was not as cold as other days though! Seeing as though we would not be able to count, we decided to change the usual pace for foggy days and drove down to the Gerbode Valley Trailhead.  <br/><br/>During our meeting, we were pleasantly surprised by a piercing howl from a coyote on the nearby ridge, holding out a beautiful tone. We were also able to spot a few raptors flying by. By the end of it, the skies seemed to hold out some hope for us as the blue of the sky began to peak and say hello. We then decided to go back to Hawk Hill to see what the conditions were and if the fog still remained, which it did. Fortunately, we saw lots from the parking lot looking down to Kirby Cove! Many Sharp-shinned Hawks flew past, a few American Kestrels, and a Peregrine Falcon was spotted just over the water. Just after we called our day, we saw an adult Red-tailed Hawk swooping and gliding while hunting down a couple of Northern Flickers! <br/><br/>The one takeaway we all took from today is that even on these dense foggy days, there are still many great things to observe and experience on the hill. With that, whatever weather the next day brings us, we're ready for it. <br/><br/>- Juan Esparza <br/><br/>Dayleader: Rod Santos <br/><br/>Count Team: Laura Coatney, Alexandra Cox, Parker Holzman Smith, Mona Broukhim, Michaela Figari, Laura Echávez, Juan Esparza <br/>

<p>It has become clear that despite our HawkWatcher's wishful thinking and positive spirit, Karl the Fog does what he pleases. The Saturday 1 team arrived at our usual meeting place right below Hawk Hill, eager to begin a day filled with blue skies and raptors flying left, right, and overhead! But alas, the fog thwarted our ambitions yet again. The team headed down to the old Marin Headlands visitor center for our morning meeting, followed by an unhurried birdwalk around Rodeo Lagoon, and made our way back up to Hawk Hill for lunch. While snacking and enjoying each other's company around the new wingspan display on the hill, we decided to make the final call that official HawkWatching was not in the cards for today. However, we did see some accipiter activity before leaving which afforded us the chance to leisurely work through some Sharp-shinned vs. Cooper's Hawk identification skills! <br/><br/>The Saturday 1 team is looking forward to our time together next cycle, where we will hopefully have an exciting peak migration day of HawkWatching! <br/><br/>-Clare SantaColoma <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Brian O'Laughlin, Mary Malec <br/><br/>Count Team: JJ Harris, Jeff Boissier, Melissa Hero, Rina Kor, Carole Garrett, Krista Fanucchi, Clare SantaColoma <br/><br/>Wingspan: Carmen DeLeon <br/>

<p>Today continued our ongoing streak of foggy days, each bearing a striking resemblance to the last. It is difficult to say for sure, but fewer days have been as foggy as it was this morning, with visibility extending barely 100 feet in any direction. The top of the hill was shrouded even from the parking lot, and the only sign of bird life was that of a Wrentit call piercing the mist. <br/><br/>Once the team was assembled, we descended to the lagoon for our morning meeting, where at least we could see each other clearly. We spent a pleasant morning strolling to the beach, perusing the groups of Brown Pelicans and Heermann's Gulls for more exotic fare, and then making our way back along Rodeo Lagoon and up the Miwok Trail before returning for lunch. Always nice to come together, even when the weather disappoints. One of these days the sky will open up and it will be birds, birds, birds, as far as the eye can see!

For the third cycle in a row, dense fog around Hawk Hill has inhibited our enthusiastic counters from doing what they do best- counting hawks! Instead, we spent the day conducting our morning meeting, giving an educational presentation to the volunteers, a brief bird-walk around Rodeo Lagoon, and repeatedly checking Karl's whereabouts on the hill. We ultimately made the final call around 1 p.m. but are keeping our hopes high for the next cycle! <br/><br/>-Clare SantaColoma <br/><br/>Dayleader: John Davis <br/><br/>Count Team: Bob Blumberg, Susan Greef, Patricia Contaxis, Mitch Green, Krista Fanucchi, Allen Fish, Clare SantaColoma <br/>

<p>Some of the better parts of our morning routine before beginning Hawkwatch is when we're driving up Conzelman Road and get to glimpse the beloved Hawk Hill from below. Although like the last few days, a thicket of dense fog has been living on the hill, thus thwarting our efforts to count raptors. You might even argue that it was the thickest amount of fog seen yet on the hill. That did not stop Wednesday 1 team from coming out and making the most out of the day! The team met around the relief map of the Marin Headlands where we analyzed and boggled our minds with the conception of landmarks and topography in relation to Hawk Hill. After many baffling revelations and amazement of our local geography, we comforted ourselves with a stroll around the lagoon, looking for any feathered animal through the lens of our bird watching instruments. We spotted some of the local birds, like Western Bluebirds, Common Yellowthroat, Hairy Woodpecker, Red-necked Phalaropes, and a few others. We were also able to glimpse a few Red-tailed Hawks and Cooper's Hawks in the far distance northeast of us enjoying their time in the fog. We ended the day happy to have seen some birds, and definitely excited for the next opportunity to be able to count raptors from Hawk Hill. <br/><br/>- Juan Esparza <br/><br/>Dayleader: Jon Altemus <br/><br/>Count Team: Jan Ambrosini, Connor Cimmiyotti, Joan Duffield, Wing Ng, John Davis, Tim Stroshane, Juan Esparza <br/>

<p>After two cycles of good visibility and warm weather gracing our Tuesday 2 team, it looks like our luck may have run out (leaving dense fog in its wake). In the spirit of optimism, we conducted our morning meeting and educational presentation at the old Marin Headlands Visitor Center after meeting in the Hawk Hill parking lot as usual. Following a brief bird-walk around Rodeo Lagoon, we moseyed back up to the parking lot and had our lunch nearby, keeping an eye on the fog surrounding the hill. Unfortunately, by 1 p.m. the fog had only gotten worse and we decided to call it for the day. Despite not being able to count, we did get a few quick glimpses of a Cooper's Hawk fly by during lunch! <br/><br/>We're looking forward to our next day out together during peak migration!  <br/><br/>-Clare SantaColoma <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Mary Kenney, Andy Bradshaw <br/><br/>Count Team: Chris Tarr, Jody Newman, Rich Eliason, Woody Woodbury, Paula Moser, Carmen DeLeon, Clare SantaColoma, Isabella Plummer <br/>

<p>Clear skies and a crisp breeze greeted the Monday 1 team, giving us all a sense that it would be a great day for counting birds (but honestly, every day is a good day for counting). The hawkwatch team began at 10 a.m. with appearances of juvenile Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures slowly making their way around the hill. The number of birds passing through increased as the day progressed and, oh boy, there were many! Kettles of Redtails would populate the sky intermittently and several American Kestrels got up close and personal with Hawk Hill. We even had a few Sharp-shinned Hawks come out of nowhere to surprise us with their presence.  Temperatures were around a balmy 62 degrees, though by early afternoon chilly winds picked up enough to make the team layer up with warmer clothing. Today was also a special day as we celebrated the late George Eade, an amazing hawkwatcher and friend to many here at GGRO. Friends gathered to share memories, laugh, and of course, look to the skies in search of birds. It was a splendid time having many hawkwatchers join us today in pursuit of continuing our research and celebrating our friend George. <br/>We wish the best of luck to tomorrow's team in counting and in good weather!<br/>--Juan Esparza<br/>Dayleader: Deborah Crooks<br/>Count Team: Denise Peck, Keith Gress, Wade Eakle, Mary Malec, Krista Fanucchi, Juan Esparza<br/><br/>

<p>Another fickle fog day wasn't going to deter the Sunday 2 team from giving it a go on Hawk Hill--albeit after a late start. We began the count at noon with little visibility in any direction and 3-7 mph winds from the west, but it soon cleared up enough to get intermittent views of Mt. Diablo. Temperatures stayed roughly in the mid-60's all day with the winds picking up to 15 mph by the 2 o'clock hour. Although our average hawk sightings per hour was only 25.7, we were able to spot three Northern Harriers, two Red-shouldered Hawks, and a Prairie Falcon kiting near Slacker Ridge. We also caught some views of one of the recently released Turkey Vultures but couldn't get its tag number. Good luck to Monday 1's team tomorrow! <br/><br/>--Isabella Plummer <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Becky Olsen, Ken Wilson <br/><br/>Count Team: Carol Weinstein, Maggie Montenegro, Kinley Renger, Cody Levin, Allen Fish, Isabella Plummer <br/>

<p>The fog couldn't quite make up its mind today, but the team counted valiantly through the ever-changing conditions. Undeterred by intermittent visibility and chilly gusts from the west, we started counting just after 11:30 a.m., when the fog showed signs of lifting. For most of the day we had great views of Mt. Diablo to the east, the air clear enough to discern the texture of its contours, while to the west the wind was consistently pushing fog up to block our view. Nevertheless, we were rewarded with good views of a pair of American Kestrels, one Osprey that passed close by, and one Red-shouldered Hawk. We were also paid a visit by Turkey Vulture #476, a juvenile that was released locally in the Headlands this week! It appeared to be tagging along behind an adult, learning how to be a vulture from the best. Great to see that #476 is doing well! Special thanks to the Roving Ranger van and our team on the wingspan platform for providing educational outreach today. We had lots of happy visitors to the hill on this beautiful weekend day. <br/><br/>- Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Jane Rudebusch, Jan Ambrosini <br/><br/>Count Team: Jennifer Miller, Tim Stroshane, Maryrose Kulick, Brian Kemler, Laura Echávez, Carmen DeLeon, Oliver Chesley  <br/>

<p>Our team promptly ascended the hill this morning around 9:15 a.m. where we were welcomed by a mystical inversion layer of fog beneath us and clear blue skies above. Landmarks and ridgelines started to slowly appear as the fog cleared after our morning meeting at 10:30 a.m., which we perceived as a sign to start counting! Temperatures were comfortable throughout the day, ranging from the low-60's to mid 70's degrees F, with wind picking up in the afternoon with gusts between 8-12 m.p.h. Some raptor highlights included three female American Kestrels flying with each other, a Peregrine Falcon swooping right past the hill, and the season's first Merlin!

<p>Our Thursday 2 team managed to eke out a full day of hawkwatching despite an intermittent fog that threatened to shut us down early. Nevertheless, it was a great day. Upon cresting the hill (but before we began counting!) we were met with a Northern Harrier that gave us some great looks as it wheeled through the breezy air and perched briefly in a nearby cypress tree. We started the count at 11 a.m. in partly foggy conditions, with winds between 10-15 mph from the west. The fog continued to blow in and out through the day, giving us brief clear views before moving back in and obscuring the landscape. Fortunately, the cloud layer stayed just at or above Hawk Hill, so we were able to maintain fairly consistent visibility of the slopes below. Highlights included a beautiful Red-shouldered Hawk that passed over the hill, and a locally banded Red-tailed Hawk hunting in the vicinity. If you ever recover a band or can clearly read a color-band on a bird, you can report the sighting at www.reportband.gov!  <br/><br/>--Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleader: Christine Cariño <br/><br/>Count Team: Jim Yampolsky, John Davis, Pauline Yeckley, Susan Greef, Laura Echávez, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<p>After a few days of thick fog, the sun decided to come out for the Wednesday 2 team! We started our count promptly at 10 a.m. with temperatures around 63 degrees and a light wind out of the southwest. The fog was creeping around, obscuring views of Mt. Tam and the East Bay, but visibility was still good enough to spot a few Red-tailed Hawks to start off the day. As the day got sunnier, the fog started dissipating and our temperatures rose to 70 degrees with winds between 8-12 mph. We were treated with a few close encounters of a Cooper's Hawk, Broad-winged Hawk, and a last-minute Red-shouldered Hawk that gave the team a chance to pick out some good fieldmarks. Our other notable sighting was that of a distant juvenile Peregrine Falcon harassing a group of Redtails.

<p>The Tuesday 2 team met on the hill under thick fog, and after finishing our greetings opted to hold the morning meeting at the old visitor center next to the lagoon. The wonderfully detailed topographic relief map of the Headlands by the visitor center proved to be a productive distraction, as we gathered around while Allen gave an impromptu lesson on wind directions and common raptor flight paths. After a brief look at the lagoon, we ventured back up to Hawk Hill under a spell of meteorological optimism and started our count close to 12:30 p.m. The fog ebbed and flowed, with moments of tantalizing brightness shining through and the sky opening intermittently to the east with views as far as Mt. Diablo. But as time wore on, the fog seemed to be winning its battle with the sun, and we called the count at 2 p.m. after seeing only a lone Turkey Vulture and a handful of juvenile Red-tailed Hawks.

<p>Along the morning commute to Hawk Hill, one could tell that our Hawkwatching day would be inundated with fog. It appeared to be thinning out at our regular start time, but dense enough to thwart our attempts to spot migrating raptors. The team decided to head into the valley where we went on a short excursion around the lagoon starting from the old Marin Headlands Visitor Center. We saw the usual flock of birds that stop by for a swim, like Brown Pelicans, Heermann's Gulls, a few Red-necked Phalaropes, and a Great Egret. We stopped by for a quick lunch at the picnic tables by the lagoon, where we shared some very delicious chocolate and had a few moments of team bonding. It was then that we saw our first raptor of the day! A juvenile Red-tailed Hawk flapped quite vigorously as it battled to gain height. With a few hopeful glimpses of the sky to trudge us on, we ultimately decided to not go forth with a counting day and instead ended the day by looping back the way we started. The Sunday 1 team is optimistic and looking forward to the next time on Hawk Hill! <br/><br/>- Juan Esparza <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Sam Hontalas, Rod Santos <br/><br/>Count Team: Laura Coatney, Melissa Kohner, Alexandra Cox, Mona Broukhim, Laura Echávez, Juan Esparza <br/>

<p>Our Saturday 1 team happily welcomed some warm weather and great visibility today, especially after the last couple of foggy, wet days! We headed straight up the hill this morning and kept our daily meeting short so that HawkWatching could start promptly at 10 a.m. Our team enjoyed a mild day with temperatures in the high 60s - low 70s degrees F, accompanied by south to southeast winds less than 5 m.p.h., and mostly clear skies above and below our position on the hill. Despite these great weather conditions for our team, today's raptor sightings were on the lower side compared to earlier this week. But we didn't let that get us down! In the middle of the afternoon, two Peregrine Falcons dove and swooped around us near and far, allowing the team to get a great view of these impressive birds from various angles. It was also noted that migration has commenced, albeit in currently slower numbers, made clear by the many juvenile Red-tailed Hawks flying with purpose high overhead (in the 5th quadrant) from the north! <br/><br/>- Clare SantaColoma <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Brian O'Laughlin, Mary Malec <br/><br/>Count Team: JJ Harris, Melissa Hero, Rina Kor, Carmen DeLeon, Krista Fanucchi, Clare SantaColoma, Carole Garrett <br/>

<p>The month of "Fogust" might be over, but the weather hasn't gotten the memo yet! Today's team met on the hill in a dense, moisture-laden fog, with our faithful friends the Ravens keeping a close watch over the morning meeting. After wrapping up, and with the prospects for hawkwatching doubtful, we opted to descend the hill for a birding walk around the lagoon. Conditions were great - not too breezy, not too cold, and the moisture freshened up the landscape just enough. On the lagoon today we saw a mixed flock of primarily Heermann's Gulls and Brown Pelicans calling and splashing up a ruckus, as well as two Red-necked Phalaropes along the edge of the lagoon. Three River Otters, always a delight, were also spotted swimming and diving together. After sharing lunch by the old visitor center and catching the last hummingbirds and nuthatches of the morning, our Friday 1 team bid each other farewell in good spirits. <br/><br/>- Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Michaela Figari, Holly Thomas <br/><br/>Count Team: Linda Sudduth, Sonja Raub, Courtney Buechert, Nick Yatsko, Laura Echávez, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<p>In sharp contrast to the past two day's unseasonably warm weather, our Thursday 1 team was met with dense fog and cooler temperatures surrounding Hawk Hill this morning. Fortunately, the AQI had improved from yesterday and didn't play a significant role in determining the safety of conducting our daily count! Upon congregating in the Hawk Hill parking lot as per usual and looking at what we could (or couldn't!) see, we decided to head over to the old Marin Headlands visitor center adjacent to Rodeo Lagoon for our morning meeting. A brief walk on the Lagoon Trail provided us with sightings of Phalaropes, Brown Pelicans, Cormorants, Pygmy Nuthatches and even a Red-tailed Hawk! Our team headed up Conzelman Road one last time in hopes the fog had cleared, and quickly decided to enjoy lunch together while we commiserated over getting fogged out two cycles in a row.

<p>Before making our appearance on Hawk Hill today, we knew we were in for a toasty, warm day. The skies were clear of any hint of clouds, but there was a definite haze surrounding us and the horizon, giving an orange tinge to the light in the early morning. Nonetheless, we were ready and prepared with all the appropriate layers of sunblock and liters of water to keep us going through the day. Our count started at 10 a.m. with an Osprey off the bat ready to be counted. Throughout the day we had Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks flying near and far, specs of Red-shouldered Hawks flying over from the north, along with two Broad-winged Hawks dipping in and out of the horizon! Towards the end of our day, we were graced with the presence of a Northern Harrier fluttering quickly south and out of our view.  <br/><br/>Looking forward to our next day with hopefully cool breezes to keep us company! <br/><br/>-- Juan Esparza, GGRO Intern <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Gretchen Zantzinger, Jon Altemus <br/><br/>Count Team: Jan Ambrosini, Connor Cimmiyotti, Kimberlie Moutoux, Wing Ng, Allen Fish, Juan Esparza <br/>

<p>Our team lucked out today with a truly beautiful day from start to finish! We conducted our morning meeting on the hill under mostly clear blue skies with slight haze and fog, a comfortable 65 degrees F, and a mild breeze between 3-7 mph. Everyone was eager to get to their posts and start counting! Like yesterday, most of the birds counted throughout the day were in and around the north quadrant, but we also had clear textbook-like sightings from above and below as raptors circled the hill. Migration season is starting to pick up, with species such as Broad-winged Hawks, American Kestrels, Red-shouldered Hawks, and the first Prairie Falcon of the season spotted today! We also had the highest count of Redtails thus far this year, coming in at a whopping 123 hawks! To finish off the day, as we all said our goodbyes in the Hawk Hill parking lot a Northern Harrier waved us off, knowing they missed our count deadline by about 30 short minutes. It's worth noting that although the birds kept coming, the air temperatures gradually increased throughout the morning and afternoon, reaching a hot 80 degrees F. Temperatures are expected to be even warmer tomorrow, so HawkWatchers should plan on bringing appropriate food, water and sun-protection! <br/><br/>Our Tuesday 1 team is excited for the rest of the season, especially because the next time we all see each other will be closer to peak migration! <br/><br/>- Clare SantaColoma, GGRO Intern <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Mary Kenney, Andy Bradshaw <br/><br/>Count Team: Chriss Tarr, Jody Newman, Rich Eliason, Woody Woodbury, Paula Moser, Carmen DeLeon, Clare SantaColoma, Isabella Plummer <br/>

<p>It was 50/50 on whether today's fog would lift or thicken, but luckily, the fog mostly stayed over the ocean, accompanied by a slight haze in all directions. Our Sunday 2 team started the count at noon with winds from the northwest at 8-12 mph and a temperature of 69 degrees F. We had a flurry of activity to start, with notable sightings of an Osprey, a few close passes by Cooper's Hawks, and a light morph and dark morph Red-tailed Hawk flying side-by-side. The winds started to pick up around 2 p.m. with gusts as high as 20 mph, but the temperature stayed about the same at 70.8 degrees F. Raptor numbers slowed down after our first hour of counting, but we still managed to sight a pair of Kestrels, male and female, flying close to the hill and one Peregrine Falcon on the north tower of the bridge.  <br/><br/>-- Isabella Plummer, GGRO Intern <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Becky Olsen, Ken Wilson <br/><br/>Count Team: Carol Weinstein, Ana Olivar, Maggie Montenegro, Kinley Renger, Cody Levin, Krista Fanucchi, Isabella Plummer <br/>

<p>Our Saturday 2 team's first day out on the hill was greeted this morning with typical "fogust" weather. A consistent breeze from the west blew the wispy fog up and over the crest of the hill, leaving little of the landscape visible. As the hawkwatch team met for introductions, the occasional Raven wheeled overhead, buffeted by the strong winds, and a small group of Band-tailed Pigeons careened across the gray sky. While the weather may not have improved today, at least we had plenty of time for questions, discussion, training, and good old friendly chatting. After the volunteer team left the hill at 1 p.m., staff members Laura, Carmen, and Oliver worked on improving the wingspan tapes located on the concrete platform just below the hilltop.

<p>The weather has certainly been all across the board on Hawk Hill this week! With fog rolling in this morning while we conducted our morning meeting and beginning-of-the-season orientation, it seemed the level of visibility could go either way. Our team started the count at noon, feeling comfortable with an air temperature hovering around 60 degrees F and 10-13mph wind gusts. Low raptor counts for the first half of the day mirrored our low visibility, but when conditions began to clear during the second half of the day our raptor sightings increased as well! At about 1:45 p.m., the team ooh-ed and ah-ed as seven Red-tailed Hawks flew above and below us. Consisting of both adults and juveniles (light and dark morph), we were able to see the stark contrast between plumages in varying lighting, angles and directions. In what was hard not to anthropomorphize as a playful action, a light morph juvenile divebombed an adult and they both proceeded to continue flying together. We stopped our count at the scheduled 3 p.m. closing time and remarked on a great day well-spent together. Friday 2 is looking forward to the rest of the season together! <br/><br/>-- Clare SantaColoma, GGRO Intern <br/><br/>Dayleader: Libby Rouan, Courtney Buechert <br/><br/>Count Team: Will Ludan, Tomas McKay, Paulette Sherry, Nick Yatsko, Krista Fanucchi, Clare SantaColoma <br/>

<p>After yesterday's highs, we experienced a bit of weather whiplash on the hill today - strong gusts of westerly wind kept temperatures to a cool but pleasant 65 degrees F. Persistent fog crowned the hilltop, shielding us from the sun (but, unfortunately, also the birds). Optimism ran high as we started the count at 12 p.m., but unfortunately optimism alone was not enough to burn away the gray. Visibility improved intermittently enough to catch glimpses of the landscape below us, but the fog never quite lifted its veil entirely, and the team was rewarded with only a small handful of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures as they appeared suddenly out of the fog before being enveloped again moments later. After an hour with no change in conditions and a mere 9 birds counted, we ended the day at 1 p.m. <br/><br/>-- Oliver Chesley, GGRO Intern <br/><br/>Dayleader: Christine Cariño <br/><br/>Count Team: Jim Yampolsky, John Davis, Pauline Yeckley, Patricia Contaxis, Lydia Bruno, Laura Echávez, Oliver Chesley <br/>

<p>It was a bit of a scorcher on Hawk Hill today, with temperatures ranging from 77-90 degrees F and little to no wind. At least the fog stayed away today, giving us beautiful views of Mount Diablo and, for a little while, the Farallon Islands. The birds also seemed to favor us today, with our sighting rate at an average of 27.5 sightings per hour. We spotted several distant kettles of Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks enjoying the thermals, but our most exciting bird of the day was a juvenile Bald Eagle--the first sighting of the season! Besides raptors, the sky was filled with the buzzing and twittering of dragonflies, butterflies, swifts, swallows, and even a small group of Purple Martins. We got an early start to the count at 10:30 a.m., but the heat was getting to us by the end of the day, and we called the count at 2:30 p.m.  <br/><br/>-- Isabella Plummer, GGRO Intern <br/><br/>Dayleader: Don Bartling <br/><br/>Count Team: Stefanie Arthur, Connor Cimmiyotti, Tom Luster, Keith Gress, Wing Ng, Isabella Plummer, Allen Fish <br/>

<p>Well, this day may have amounted to one of the better days of hawkwatch so far! Crystal clear skies, not too warm (hovering around 70-78 degrees F) with just the right amount of 3-7 mph ocean breeze washing over our faces. Not only that, but we counted the most birds out of all the hawkwatch days thus far! Not that any of us are keeping track of course. Today's team was glowing, working in perfect, harmonized unison when calling out birds and identifying them quickly with much confidence. Highlights included a pair of Cooper's Hawks dancing through the sky, taking turns in hot pursuit, chasing one another. There was also the first White-tailed Kite sighting of the season. In total, the team counted 121 bird sightings! We kept an average of 34.6 sightings per hour, starting the count day at 11:30 a.m. and ending at 3 p.m. Though we are not at the peak of our season just yet, with more species and a higher volume of birds flying around, today was a good sign for what's to come as the weeks go by.  <br/><br/>-- Juan Esparza & Oliver Chesley, GGRO Interns <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Horacio Mena, Pat Bacchetti <br/><br/>Count Team: Woody Woodbury, Maureen Grabowski, Dennis Davison, Mary Kenney, Carmen DeLeon, Oliver Chesley, Juan Esparza <br/>

<p>Even though Hurricane Hilary is all the way in Southern California, Hawk Hill was not immune to her impacts today. We started our count at 11:45 a.m. with views of the Bay Bridge below the fog bank, but by noon we were completed socked in. Temperatures stayed around 63 degrees with southerly winds up to 22 mph and a surprising amount of humidity. Our only sighting for the day was a small flock of Band-tailed Pigeons that disappeared into the fog almost immediately after being spotted. With no sign of the fog lifting, Hawkwatch left the hill at 1 p.m. Hopefully tomorrow's crew will have better luck! <br/><br/>-- Isabella Plummer, GGRO intern<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Linda Schneider, James McDermott<br/><br/>Count Team: Roy Pisetsky, Deborah Crooks, Peter Sapienza, Denise Peck, Jared Westbrook, Isabella Plummer, Laura Echávez, Allen Fish<br/>

<p>Here at GGRO, not only are we good at talking about and counting birds, but we're also great at talking about the weather. For those of you who are curious about our ever-fluctuating weather patterns, it was an incredibly scorching day (at least that is what the general consensus was amongst today's hawkwatchers). We were at the mercy of the elements, hoping for a cool breeze from the ocean to wash over us and cool us off. Alas, even the wind that we have been getting all week did not make an appearance.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>For the first day for Sunday's 1 team, we were thrown straight into what felt like the toughest day of the season so far, but handled it like champs! No heat can stop these hawkwatchers from counting. Not too many birds were out today, with a total of 36 birds being counted over 3.25 hours. Despite the heat, we were graced with the appearance of a dark morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawk! Not only that, but we also gathered around to spot and identify a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk, where we were easily able to pick up on the translucent light crescents in it's wings. We are most definitely excited to start seeing more of our migrating friends to make an appearance, and ready for when they do!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>- Juan Esparza<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Sam Hontalas, Rod Santos<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Count Team: Laura Coatney, Melissa Kohner, Alexandra Cox, Parker Holzman Smith, Mona Broukhim, Laura Echavez, Juan Esparza<br/>

<p>We had a great first Saturday 1! Unfortunately, the fog was at it again and our team was unable to conduct any official HawkWatching today despite our best efforts. However, this allowed for a longer foggy morning meeting filled with heartfelt introductions between new and old HawkWatchers! Staff also shared notes and updates regarding changes and reminders for the upcoming season, and our intern gave an educational presentation to volunteers. Aside from low visibility, the air was mostly warm with a mild, sustained wind throughout the morning, picking up in the afternoon.

<p>The weather warmed a bit for us on this very first Friday of the season, after a mostly foggy week. A high cloud ceiling and a mild breeze started off our morning with good visibility in all directions, an auspicious sign for the day to come. And another sign of feathered favor - a pair of Common Ravens kindly attended our morning meeting, inching closer as we made our way through the agenda (to better hear Allen wax poetic about birds, no doubt). They remained our companions throughout the day and saw us off at the close. As the hours passed the temperature warmed, the clouds cleared, and the northwesterly wind picked up in gusts, occasionally removing hats from unsuspecting heads. The birds picked up as well, with Red-tailed Hawks at the forefront of the day's count. The team spotted 96 total birds, or a respectable 27.4 raptors per hour - great early-season numbers! We also had the pleasure of being joined on the hill by NPS GGNRA superintendent, David Smith, who arrived mid-day to meet the team and learn about birds with his young niece. Thanks for stopping by David! All in all, a wonderful day on the hill. <br/><br/>- Oliver Chesley <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Michaela Figari, Holly Thomas <br/><br/>Count team: Linda Sudduth, Yvette MacDonald, Sonja Raub, Courtney Buechert, Nick Yatsko, John Davis, Oliver Chesley, Laura Echávez, Allen Fish <br/>

<p>We had a great first Thursday 1 today, despite the fog inhibiting our team from actually leaving the Hawk Hill parking lot! The last few mornings this week have started off foggy but cleared up mid-morning/afternoon, so we were hopeful we'd be able to get up to the hill and start counting some raptors, but alas, the fog had other plans. However, this allowed our team to spend some quality time together! We were able to have a much needed, in-depth meeting about the upcoming season as well as an educational presentation to the volunteers given by our intern. Fortunately, whether the fog was present or not this week, we've lucked out with some warm weather!

<p>Sun! Then some fog, but then some more sun! Then a thick blanket of fog bringing alongside gusts of chilly wind (up to 27 mph)! The weather was relentless today, playing with our hearts and soul. But our team today was not shaken! We were hopeful to spot some early migratory raptors for day one of the Wednesday season. Despite the variation of clear skies and dense fog, we were still able to spot out some common raptor species up on the hill. We were lucky that a few folks from the team brought up some cookies to warm up our souls as we scanned the skies for our friends. It was a slow day today with not too many raptors being seen. Overall we observed 9.5 birds per hour, with the majority of them being Turkey Vultures. A few Cooper's Hawks and Red-tailed Hawks were seen, along with the first sighting of a Sharp-shinned Hawk for the season!<br/>Things are off to a slow start, but the buzz and excitement for the season is here and we are ready for all the raptors! <br/>- Juan Esparza<br/>Dayleaders: Gretchen Zantzinger, Jon Altemus<br/>Count Team: Jan Ambrosini, Joan Duffield, Kimberlie Moutoux, Wing Ng, Juan Esparza, Allen Fish<br/><br/>

<p>Tuesday 1 - 8/15/23 <br/><br/>We had a great day out on Hawk Hill during our first Tuesday 1 of the season! The morning started off foggy, and we conducted our morning meeting unsure if the sky would clear up or if we'd be sent down the hill early. Fortunately, the fog cleared as our meeting finished up around 11 a.m. and we were met with beautiful blue skies, ready to spot raptors! Our team was excited to be there and help train our two new interns, Clare and Isabella. They were trained on Dunkadoo and all aspects of conducting our formal Hawk Count up on the hill. There weren't many raptors to be had- overall we spotted many Turkey Vultures, a handful of Red-tailed Hawks (both juveniles and adults), and one juvenile male Cooper's Hawk as it rose above Hawk Hill. One of our Redtails was even a dark-morph juvenile which was exciting for everyone! At the very end of the day, an Osprey must have been able to sense we had just finished our count, because it flew gracefully past us at 3:13 p.m. The team felt warm throughout the day, with temperatures ranging from about 65-73 degrees and clear skies, despite consistent westerly and northerly winds with gusts up to nearly 30 mph. <br/><br/>The entire team is feeling invigorated after a beautiful day out on the hill and can't wait to see how the rest of the season unfolds! <br/><br/>-Clare SantaColoma, Carmen DeLeon and Isabella Plummer <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Mary Kenney, Andy Bradshaw <br/><br/>Count Team: Chris Tarr, Jody Newman, Rich Eliason, Woody Woodbury, Paula Moser, Carmen DeLeon, Clare SantaColoma, Isabella Plummer <br/>

<p>The first day of Hawkwatch season is upon us! A small but mighty team kicked off the season with quick reflexes to spot raptors soaring through the sky, weaving in and out of the fog. The sun joined us for the first hour of counting, but quickly retreated behind some clouds as the day progressed. Dense fog, brisk winds, and even a little bit of rain accompanied the hawkwatch team as we kept our eyes peeled for feathered friends. <br/><br/>Starting off this season's count, we observed 11.4 birds per hour! There were plenty of Turkey Vultures, a few close encounters with Red-tailed Hawks, and a Cooper's Hawk that swiftly flew by and disappeared in the fog below the Golden Gate Bridge. At one point, a Northern Harrier darted over our heads; even a Peregrine Falcon made an appearance on this eventful first day of counting!
