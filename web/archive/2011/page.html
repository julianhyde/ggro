<p>The final day of Hawk Watch for the 2011 season was a spectacular day up on the hill. Mostly clear skies and a gentle breeze brought a fair share of late migrants, including more than a dozen Northern Harriers. A far off Swainson's Hawk was a pleasant surprise. A number of non-raptors visited the hill as well- White-throated Swifts and Violet-green Tree Swallows showed off, keeping the Hawk Watchers on their toes with their incredible Merlin impersonations. Unfortunately, that wraps up the season without a single sighting of a Rough-legged Hawk. Hopefully we will have better luck next year! Until 2012.... this is Hawk Watch out. <br/>

<p>What a perfect way to end the season! Though the gusty winds were still present today, they weren't persistent enough to blow us off the hill. They were, however, strong enough to give us an amazing variety of birds. We ended up seeing -12- species! By noon the activity had died down, when all of a sudden, a juvenile Bald Eagle AND a partial albino adult Red-tail popped up in the south quadrant. About an hour later, a juvenile Golden Eagle was spotted in the north. The rest of the day we enjoyed seeing almost 200 Red-tails -- 2 of which were brought up to the hill by banders to be released so we could see them up close! The day ended with an Osprey flying directly overhead as we posed for a final group photo of us "hawk-upying" Hawk Hill.<br/><br/>Saturday II - you guys are awesome! Thanks for a fun season! <br/>

<p>A very windy day on Hawkwatch, with wind speeds reaching over 55 miles per hour! Volunteers were eventually blown off the hill, but while they were able to hold their optics straight they were able to see many exciting birds, including a few dark morph Red-tailed Hawks and some beautiful adult accipiters! Although a bit slow, everyone's spirits were held high as we finished off the Thursday II season.<br/>

<p>A wonderful watch, with wicked winds wantonly winding around the hill!  While enjoying the wonderful feast orchestrated by David and Lynn Jesus, we spotted a huge number of birds for this time of year- more than the last 3 days totals combined! The Red-tails were especially productive today- and we saw lots of dark morphs, including an adult Harlan's Hawk! We also enjoyed watching the 9 Peregrine Falcons, which had no trouble in the wind even as we struggled to remain upright. Other highlights included two Red-shouldered Hawks and three Northern Harriers. What a wonderful day to end my hawkwatch season; thank you to everyone who made this year special for me! <br/>

<p>What a beautiful day to end the season for Tuesday II's team! The view from Hawk Hill was surreal - a sea of fog stretched out below us in all directions for most of the day. We could just see the tips of the Golden Gate Bridge towers and Sutro Tower resting atop the foggy ocean until around 12:30 when the fog cleared a bit and we finally saw our first birds! Though the raptor flow was very slow today, we had a wonderful potluck that kept us occupied while we watched the empty skies. Thanks for an awesome season Tuesday II!! <br/>

<p>A nice end to Monday II's adventures, even if we didn't see very many hawks. Ironically, the day started off foggy everywhere except on the top of Hawk Hill, which caused us some amusement. Hawkwatch volunteers enjoyed an assortment of pies and delighted in the great views of juvenile Northern Harriers. We also got a great look at a Merlin released from Hawk Blind. Other treats included large flocks of American Robins, a group of Western Bluebirds, and swirling columns of White-throated Swifts and Violet-green Swallows.  <br/>

<p>A surprisingly warm day on the hill, but unfortunately not very many hawks. We did see some lovely adult Cooper's hawks and got good looks at two gorgeous juvenile Northern Harriers. We also enjoyed watching a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk play around with Hawk Blind. May the winds and hawks pick up next week! <br/>

<h2><a name='20111126'/>Saturday, November 26, 2011</h2>
<p>A blustery day on Hawk Hill with wind speed exceeding 16mph for most of the day. Fortunately some hawks blew our way with more birds than there have been lately. Highlights included an adult Red-shouldered Hawk that flew directly over volunteers as it was harassed by two Common Ravens. Thrills and chills were experienced when an adult Peregrine also flew overhead as well. Another quality sighting was a dark morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawk that flew around from the south quadrant past volunteers and into the north. An excellent way to end the season for the Saturday I Team!<br/>

<p>A slow, overcast day on Hawkwatch, but volunteers did spot a juvenile dark morph Red-tailed Hawk that was battling with a couple adult Red-tails in the south quadrant. Though the day ended early, the last half hour brought sightings of two adult Peregrine Falcons flying over the pines. The season certainly seems to be slowing down a bit, but hopefully tomorrow will bring in some exciting Thanksgiving birds other than Turkey Vultures!<br/>

<p>The day started out pretty overcast with winds from the southeast. Although the flow of hawks was pretty slow today, we enjoyed our last day on the hill with cheese and crackers and Tim's excellent chardonnay. Highlights today were the Northern Harrier dive-bombing the raven mob and the Swainson's Hawk we spotted sneaking over the bay in South Quadrant. No accipiters today, surprisingly!<br/>

<p>Partly cloudy skies, a slight breeze throughout most of the day, and bright sunshine made today a beautiful day atop Hawk Hill. The raptors didn't seem to appreciate the break from yesterday's rain, though. Numbers were low, but the day began and ended with sightings of Swainson's Hawks, which are always exciting sights to see. A handful of American Kestrels, a few Northern Harriers, and an Osprey also kept us on our toes. Let's hope the beautiful weather continues and brings with it another push of hawks later this week. Stay tuned...<br/>

<p>Today started off warm and sunny with clear skies and wind from the northwest. The weather slowly progressed into cold and overcast with a threat of rain and strong winds from the south. Though today was slow, we still saw several Red-tails and a handful of Peregrine Falcons. The highlight of the day was seeing a couple of adult Peregrines race around Hawk Hill - one zoomed right next to the west platform and gave us a great view without binoculars. During the slower times, the Ravens kept us entertained, gathering in unkindnesses* of 12 or more and barrel rolling through the sky. <br/><br/><br/>*Unkindness: n., a group of ravens.<br/>

<p>A beautiful day on Hawk Hill.

<p>A beautiful day on the hawkwatch, though it started out a little slow. When the winds finally came in the early afternoon, we had a huge peak of Red-tailed Hawk activity. We saw 100 juvenile Red-tailed Hawks today! One of the Red-tails that we saw was a light morph adult Harlan's type, and provided a nice challenge for the hawkwatchers. We also saw a dark morph juvenile Swainson's Hawk above Kirby Cove, which gave us a great view. We also had some very nice Peregrine Falcon sightings today, along with a lot of Northern Harriers.  <br/>

<p>A calm fall day with perfectly clear skies.

We also spotted a mysterious dark-backed buteo flying low over the water in the last half hour ... A kettle of 9 or so Turkey Vultures formed a couple of times to the north and Red-tails kept us entertained throughout the day. <br/>

<p>Wow, what a beautiful day on the hill! The day started out pretty rapidly with a juvenile Bald Eagle sighting as the first bird of the day. The Bald flew right over Hawk Hill and commenced soaring; an angry adult Peregrine soon joined it. Not long after, a juvenile Swainson's Hawk flew right by the hill. We had 10 species before we had completed the first hour, which might be a new record! Today was a great day for Peregrine and Merlin sightings, and we also saw quite a few White-tailed Kites and Northern Harriers. Although the hawks slowed down towards the end of the day, we were treated to another rare sight- a Golden Eagle circling by the FM towers. Definitely one of the most memorable days this season!<br/>

<p>The day started out pretty cloudy, surprisingly mostly from the east! Likewise, the wind and the birds were more numerous in the morning as well. We a got a lot of good looks at adult accipiters and juvenile Red-shouldered Hawks today, as well as a few dark morph Red-tails. One of the dark morphs, an adult, had a really interesting "tiger-barred" tail. At one point, we had three ethereal White-tailed Kites soaring together over the pines. Overall, a great day, even if it ended pretty slowly. <br/>

<p>A good late season day on Hawk Hill.

Both an adult and juvenile dark morph Red-tailed Hawks flew overhead as well, adding some excitement to the day. Other highlights included a couple close adult accipiters.<br/>

Though the view is awesome from Hawk Hill when a storm is rolling in, we decided to not chance our scopes serving as lightning rods and retreated around 12:30. Stay tuned for more raptor sightings after the storm passes! .... <br/>

We did, however, see 10 Northern Harriers and got a nice view of a White-tailed Kite. A handful of Merlins and Kestrels made an appearance as well. <br/><br/>To the Thursday I team: Robyn & I had an amazing time with everyone! Thank you for all the tasty food and general awesomeness!

<p>Although it was a relatively slow day on the hill, there were some really exciting sightings including an adult Peregrine Falcon that perched on one of the pine trees on top of Hawk Hill and sat there quite cooperatively for Hawkwatch volunteers and visitors alike. There was also a fabulous sighting of a juvenile Bald Eagle that flew out of the south quadrant and came within twenty meters of Hawk Hill!<br/>

<p>A nice day on the hill- it wasn't too cold and windy, but there weren't that many hawks. The highlights for today were the Osprey cruising over the lagoon and the three White-tailed Kites we saw around noon. We saw a lot of juvenile Red-tailed Hawks today, including some dark morphs, and a male American Kestrel gave us a show hovering over Hawk Blind. A good day overall. <br/>

<p>What a beautiful day for a hawk watch- if only there were hawks! We saw a slow dribble of hawks throughout most of the day, but only 19 individuals were counted in the last hour and a half. Winds were out of the south in the morning, but switched to west, then northwest in the afternoon. Highlights of the day included two Merlins, two Red-shouldered Hawks, and two American Kestrels. Hopefully numbers will pick up before the weather takes a turn for the worse. <br/>

<p>Though it was cold and cloudy atop the hill today, the hawk watchers stayed dry for the most part. However, the raptors seemed to have forgotten to set their clocks back; numbers were low for what seemed like good conditions, with winds from the north for most of the day. We spotted a handful of White-tailed Kites, some American Kestrels, the regular Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures, and a pair of Peregrine Falcons that soared over the hill almost the entire day, wowing us with their acrobatic stunts. They even dove on an unsuspecting Red-tail, which immediately high-tailed it out of the area. With this weird weather, who knows what tomorrow will bring? <br/>

<p>Both the rain and the birds trickled on and off today. Despite the blustery weather, we enjoyed seeing 2 White-tailed Kites - one right over Hawk Hill! - and nice views of Peregrine Falcons. Both the adult Peregrines and adult Red-tails were observed defending their territories throughout the day. A dark ominous cloud moved toward us from Mt. Tam as we retreated from Hawk Hill, but stunning skies and great company made for a nice day. <br/>

<p>A fantastic day on Hawk Hill! Though a bit brisk with a north-westerly wind, the skies were clear allowing Hawkwatchers to see FIVE eagles, a few White-tailed Kites, and some Northern Harriers. It was also remarkable that 15 Peregrine Falcons were seen, including the bridge pair that were seen calling and defending the territory in Kirby Cove from intruding migrants! There was also a sighting of a 14th species, a Short-eared Owl that flew over volunteers ending the day with another great raptor.<br/>

<p>Rain and fog got the best of the Hawkwatchers today, but there were a few great sightings early on in the day. A juvenile Northern Harrier blasted through the fog right over the platform, and a few Peregrine Falcons were sighted in the east including the two adults perched side by side on the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge. Though Hawkwatchers were unable to see it through the fog, Eddie Bartley of the banders reported a sighting of a Goshawk early in the day and the volunteers who returned to the office were able to see the telemetry bird, a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk, before its release this afternoon!<br/>

<p>Though the day started out windy like yesterday, winds died down by early afternoon, seemingly as much to the delight of the raptors as the hawk watchers. We saw a total of eleven species, including two White-tailed Kites, a number of juvenile Northern Harriers, and a Merlin that perched in a tree for over an hour in full view of our west quadrant. We once again had some great sightings of adult accipiters, and a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk made an appearance, taking a quick trip through Kirby Cove before heading back to the north.  <br/>

<p>It was a very windy day atop Hawk Hill. Winds were out of the north for most of the day, with gusts as strong as 23mph recorded. That wind sure did blow in some incredible bird species; sightings included an adult Bald Eagle, a juvenile Golden Eagle, and two juvenile Ferruginous Hawks. We also saw tons of Red-tailed Hawks, some of which showed very interesting color morphs. Still no sign of our first Rough-legged Hawk of the season- perhaps tomorrow will be the day!  <br/>

<p>Happy Hawkwatch Halloween! The hawks were up to their usual trickery today, as they seemed to have put on their camouflaged  Halloween costumes! We had very low raptor activity at the beginning of the day, with only one ghostly White-tailed Kite seen in the first half hour! However, we did get a few treats- an adult Harlan's Hawk crossing the Golden Gate Bridge. Also, a beautiful tundrius juvenile Peregrine Falcon flew right in front of the north platform. We also got some great looks at Varied Thrush in their festive Halloween colors. <br/>

<p>Another great day for Hawkwatchers! Some really exciting birds made appearances today including the second Golden Eagle of the season who was harassed by some ravens right by the pines in the west quadrant before cruising around the Golden Gate Bridge! Another really spectacular sighting was a dark morph Swainson's Hawk that cruised through the Headlands in the afternoon, first sighted over by Mount Tamalpais, the Swainson's Hawk headed towards Hawk Hill, but did not get quite as close as the eagle. Other thrilling sightings included a Peregrine Falcon by Hill 88, a couple early morning White-tailed Kites, and a couple close Red-shouldered Hawks.<br/>

Another day when the Red-tail count greatly exceeded the accipiter count. Our day started off with 2 adult Peregrine Falcons flying right over Hawk Hill and we ended up seeing 3 more throughout the day.

<p>A genuinely remarkable day on Hawkwatch! With literally dozens of falcons, 4 White-tailed Kites, 17 Northern Harriers (one of which was captured by HAWK blind and released for an ID study, the first NOHA for the banders this season) an adult Ferruginous Hawk that appeared low over the pines beyond the south and west platforms, a Broad-winged Hawk, and many more magnificent birds were seen from Hawk Hill. Megan led an educational program for a group of excited kindergarteners on the lower platform when an adult Peregrine Falcon took a tremendous stoop on a juvenile right above them- tearing through the pine trees, talons blazing, and both birds shrieking with gusto. The capstone to the day was a juvenile Bald Eagle that made an appearance right at 3:25 in the north saddle making the Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vulture in the same kettle look like accipiters. The eagle then proceeded to cross the bay into San Francisco over Crissy Field ending the day on a high note with a total of 13 species!<br/>

We went on to see 6 more Peregrines throughout the day, including a tundrius juvenile! We also had a great run of Merlins today, including one who gave us quite a show snacking on dragonflies. We also enjoyed watching four White-tailed Kites sail through the skies, along with some gorgeous dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks. <br/>

Perhaps next time the weather will cooperate for more raptor-tastic conditions.   <br/>

<p>What a wonderful falcon day! We were astounded by how many Merlins we saw eating dragonflies- 20 total for the day, with each subspecies being represented. Other highlights was the glorious adult Ferruginous Hawk late in the day and four Osprey. We also saw a few beautiful dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks. A 13 species day- I believe that is a new record for this season! <br/>

<p>Although it was overcast all day, the weather was really mild and the winds were low. Although we didn't see a large number of hawks, we really enjoyed a close up sighting of a Broad-winged Hawk and a Merlin catching dragonflies. We also caught a glimpse of an adult male and female Northern Harrier, which was a nice identification challenge. We enjoyed watching a male Kestrel dive bombing an adult Red-tail later in the day when things were a little slow.<br/>

<p>A foggy start to yet another exciting day on Hawkwatch. The real highlight of the day was a couple of juvenile Peregrine Falcons that were making passes by POAK and HAWK blinds, including aerial attacks on one another right in front of the north platform, a really fantastic display on a relatively slow day! Other thrilling sightings included a couple Merlins that flew high overhead and a high proportion of adult accipiters. <br/>

<p>Beautiful but hot day on the top of the hill. The morning was very busy and windy, but when the winds died down around noon and so did the corresponding numbers of hawks. However, we saw a good amount of species today. Some of our favorites were the beautiful male Northern Harrier flying high overhead, a gorgeous Osprey rising from the rifle range, and a couple of Merlins enjoying a tasty snack of dragonflies above the pines. Altogether a great day, even if we got a little sunburned!<br/>

<p>Though the morning outlook seemed bleak, Hawkwatchers took a birding hike on the Bobcat Trail and spotted several passerines including a handsome Fox Sparrow.  The afternoon cleared the skies enough to allow volunteers up on Hawk Hill, but variable fog conditions left Hawkwatch volunteers in suspense with accipiters and kestrels emerging from the swirling whiteness. The real highlight of the afternoon was the brilliant plumage of a juvenile dark morph Broad-winged Hawk!<br/>

<p>What a day to be looking at the sky! Accipiters gathered in kettles of 10 or more over Hawk Hill all day. Raptors were zooming overhead while the Blue Angels did the same. Some excitement for the day (other than seeing 335 Sharpies and 143 Coops) included seeing a dark-morph Broad-winged Hawk and a Ferruginous Hawk. A wonderful day for hawk watching with beautiful weather! Tomorrow should be a similar day, so come visit Hawk Hill if you can! <br/>

<p>Despite the distraction of non-raptorial aerial acrobatics with the Blue Angels overhead, there were sightings of hundreds of accipiters, a few falcons, several Broad-winged Hawks, and many Red-shouldered Hawks! Overall it was a thrilling day with over 125 hawks per hour, and after months of not even breaking 500 birds in a day, today's total of 751 was really exhilarating. It seems that peak has arrived a little late this year, but hopefully the weather will keep the birds flowing through the Headlands en masse!<br/>

<p>The team was very excited to go to Hawk Hill today, since the weather had forecasted rain all day. Although a few squalls missed us earlier in the day, big thunderclouds pushed us off the hill shortly after 2. Highlights today were definitely the falcons! We got close up looks at male Kestrels and a beautiful adult Peregrine that flew over the pines. We also got a good look at a Broad-winged Hawk and an adult Cooper's Hawk. All in all, a very satisfying day, even though the numbers weren't high. <br/>

<p>A beautiful fall day in the headlands. Unfortunately, however, no time was spent on Hawk Hill due to a persistent cloud that sat on top of the hill all day. While waiting for the cloud to blow away, we hiked down to Kirby Cove and saw a large pod of Harbor Porpoises. An Osprey was also spotted just above us. On our way back up the trail, Red-tails were being bombed left and right. First by a male American Kestrel and then another by a pair of Peregrine Falcons. <br/>

Though this weather was ideal for hawk watching, the hawks seemed to disagree with it and trickled through the headlands lazily.

In addition to the fog migration, we saw a couple of Red-tailed Hawks - one (a rufous morph) was perched and eating lunch, and the other was diving to grab some lunch. We also heard a loud call coming from the marshy area off of Miwok trail, which we think may have been a Rail. <br/>

<p>Another beautiful hawkwatch day- hot in the morning and cool and windy in the afternoon! We saw a total of 361 birds today, with our most common species being Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, Sharp-shinned, and Cooper's Hawks. However, we saw quite a few Kestrels, Broad-winged Hawks, and Merlins, as well as three Osprey. We had thrilling close up views of a Merlin and two Broad-wings, and quite a few challenging kettles of buteos, vultures, and accipiters. <br/>

<p>What a perfect day for hawk watching! I knew it was going to be a good day when I woke up and saw sunshine at 7AM for the first time ever out here! The afternoon was pretty hot, but we powered through it with excitement for the perfect weather and plentiful raptors flying overhead. Some of the excitement today included seeing a handful of Broad-winged Hawks (including a dark morph), a Ferruginous Hawk, a Red-shouldered Hawk, and an Osprey.  <br/>

<p>Wow! Another gorgeous, and very hot, hawkwatch day! The team was excited to get 12 species today, with 360 total sightings. Our most common species were Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and Sharp-shinned Hawks, but we also saw quite a few Cooper's and Red-shouldered Hawks. The highlight of the day was definitely a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk that gave us a clear view of his "three points of light." However, we were also delighted by a few Broad-winged Hawks, a Merlin, and an Osprey. Great day Monday II!<br/>

<p>Such a beautiful day for the hawkwatch! Weather was hot and sunny all day with very light breezes, so we were off to a slow start at first. However, the day ended up being a great success, with Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, and Sharp-shinned hawks being our most common species. Highlights included 4 Osprey, 3 Peregrine Falcons, and a beautiful close-up Merlin late in the day. May there be many more days like this to come!<br/>

Though we never made it up to Hawk Hill, we enjoyed birding near Rodeo Lagoon and at the Annex.

<p>Holy cow, there really is a migration! Today brought a huge spike in the number of raptors moving through the headlands- a total of 308 sightings were made over the course of the day. We saw quite a bit of accipiter activity, and Red-tailed Hawks were boiling out of the valley. Highlights of the day included a brief sighting of a Merlin, four Osprey cruising through, and a Northern Harrier hanging out over Slacker Hill.

<p>We were assigned to Fog Watch again today. We saw lots of fog! So overall a great day for fog watchers.<br/><br/>During our fog observations, we hiked along Bobcat Trail and ended up seeing several Red-tailed Hawks, a few American Kestrels, a Northern Harrier, a White-tailed Kite, and a Great Horned Owl (perched in the brush in the middle of Gerbode Valley). We're thinking about possibly starting a Hawk Watch program and ditching the Fog Watch. <br/>

<p>This morning we were all sure that the fog was going to hang around all day. Around 10:30, we began to go birding around the lagoon when we saw blue sky and sunshine peaking through the fog near Hawk Hill and decided it was time to start counting hawks! When we arrived at the top of the hill, we were surrounded by sunshine and perfect weather. A Peregrine flew right overhead, while a group of 8 Red-tails soared over Angel Island, and an Osprey was spotted off in the distance. Overall, a great day! <br/>

We had a total of 168 raptors sighted today, with our most common birds being the usual Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures. We sighted 5 Ospreys today, one of which flew right over the hill top, giving us a great view!

When we came back down the hill, we did go on a nice bird walk around the lagoon and saw a few kestrels and turkey vultures. Keep your fingers crossed for sunshine!<br/>

Unfortunately, by 12:45 the fog reappeared with reinforcements, and we had to end our count early, despite our valiant efforts. However, the day still proved fruitful with 30 Turkey Vultures, 13 Red-tailed Hawks, 5 Red-shouldered Hawks, and one each of an Opsrey, a Northern Harrier, and a Cooper's Hawk. We also saw a flock of Black Swifts, as well as some very adorable Blue-gray Gnatcatchers. Hopefully we'll have more time with the birds next cycle!  <br/>

<p>Welcome to the Land of Fog! Unfortunately we were unable to get up to Hawk Hill today. We spent some time attempting to bird around Rodeo Lagoon, but the birds all seemed to be hiding away from the cold fog -- minus our resident female American Kestrel, who perches atop a telephone pole near the lagoon and always provides us with a little solace on these fogged out days. We ate lunch at the Annex with hopes of skies clearing in the afternoon. Despite the never-ending wall of white, we spotted an adult Red-tailed Hawk fly through the valley below the Annex only to disappear moments later. <br/>

<p>Regrettably, yesterday's beautiful weather decided not to stick around, and suffocating tendrils of fog gripped the hill all morning, forcing us to abandon the count for the day. The hawkwatch team spent the morning wandering the lagoon, and enjoyed good looks at Common Mergansers, Western Bluebirds, Chestnut-backed Chickadees, and a female Kestrel on a wire. We also got some good looks at our Kirby Cove Red-tailed Hawk pair. I'm beginning to think we should change Hawk Hill's name into "Fog Hill," and the GGRO into the "Golden Gate Fog Observatory."

<p>Although our hopes for a beautiful clear hill were high today, the fog proved uncooperative once again. However, the team enjoyed watching the juvenile and adult red-tails from the annex, and a Cooper's Hawk flying into view over south slacker a few times. Our most exciting raptor encounter came around 1:00, when one of the adult Peregrines, calling like crazy, stooped upon a Cooper's Hawk who quickly dropped into the safety of the trees. It's really too bad the fog insisted on hanging around the hill today!<br/>

<p>Though the day started out foggy and gloomy, the fog lifted enough for us to take data at the hill today (finally)! We had a pretty good raptor show today, with Turkey Vultures and Red-tails being our main stars. The highlights included a Peregrine/Redtail aerial battle, a good overhead look at a few juvenile Cooper's Hawks, an exciting potential Merlin sighting, and a late Osprey. Spotted Towhees and Band-tailed Pigeons provided additional entertainment.

<p>Hawkwatchers finally made it up on Hawk Hill for the second day this season! Unfortunately the morning sunshine did not last through the day. However, while the sun was out several exciting birds were counted including a juvenile Cooper's Hawk that stormed the platform, a juvenile Red-Shouldered Hawk, and (my personal favorite) a juvenile Peregrine Falcon! We were also entertained by the pair of Common Ravens and a flirtatious Wrentit while we waited for the fog to lift. <br/>

<p>The fog has graced us with its presence once again today. The coastal flora must be happy. We were unable to record any data today, but volunteers enjoyed birding around Rodeo Lagoon and up Miwok trail. Despite the fog keeping us from Hawk Hill, it was a beautiful morning and we saw a handful of Red-tailed Hawks stilling just below the blanket of fog and taking advantage of wind currents to soar around the hills. We also saw a female American Kestrel, a group of Red-necked Phalaropes, and some bright Western Bluebirds. A great day nonetheless, but we're ready for a day of sunshine! <br/>

<p>Once again, the fog has rudely interrupted our plans for a full hawkwatch, and we were unable to make it up to the hill today. However, the team went on a nice birdwalk by the lagoon, and we did see the vagrant Pacific Golden-Plover that birders sighted on Rodeo Beach. Other highlights were a Red-necked Phalarope, Common Mergansers, Willets, and a far off Osprey! We also saw a few hungry juvenile Red-tailed Hawks when we were waiting for the fog to lift at the annex. Hopefully the skies will clear up tomorrow.  <br/>

<p>Unfortunately, the fog prevented us from going up onto the hill for the second day in a row. Some local birding revealed Red-necked Phalaropes, a Green-backed Heron, some Common Yellowthroats, a Marsh Wren, a Wrentit, a few American Kestrels, Double-crested Cormorants, Killdeer, Common Mergansers, Heermann's Gulls, Song Sparrows, White-crowned Sparrows, a Pied-billed Grebe, and California Towhees. Hopefully we'll have better luck with the raptors tomorrow! Stay tuned....<br/>

<p>Unfortunately day two did not have yesterday's sunny skies, but rather a continuous layer of fog. However, volunteers spent the morning birding around the bobcat trail and Rodeo Lagoon. The highlight of the day was a boisterous group of Red-necked Phalaropes and a few female American Kestrels. Hopefully we will have better luck next week!<br/>

<p>What a great start to the season! Spirits were as high as the hope that the fog would disappear, particularly when a beautiful White-tailed Kite materialized from the fog and made its way toward Rodeo Lagoon. Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures meandered through the sky, and a few female American Kestrels were diving among the coyote bushes. Peregrine Falcons zoomed around the Golden Gate Bridge, fiercely patrolling the skies. <br/>
