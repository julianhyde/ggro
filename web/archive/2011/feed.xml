Mostly clear skies and a gentle breeze brought a fair share of late migrants, including more than a dozen Northern Harriers. A far off Swainson's Hawk was a pleasant surprise. A number of non-raptors visited the hill as well- White-throated Swifts and Violet-green Tree Swallows showed off, keeping the Hawk Watchers on their toes with their incredible Merlin impersonations. Unfortunately, that wraps up the season without a single sighting of a Rough-legged Hawk. Hopefully we will have better luck next year! Until 2012.... this is Hawk Watch out. &lt;br/&gt;

Though the gusty winds were still present today, they weren't persistent enough to blow us off the hill. They were, however, strong enough to give us an amazing variety of birds. We ended up seeing -12- species! By noon the activity had died down, when all of a sudden, a juvenile Bald Eagle AND a partial albino adult Red-tail popped up in the south quadrant. About an hour later, a juvenile Golden Eagle was spotted in the north. The rest of the day we enjoyed seeing almost 200 Red-tails -- 2 of which were brought up to the hill by banders to be released so we could see them up close! The day ended with an Osprey flying directly overhead as we posed for a final group photo of us "hawk-upying" Hawk Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saturday II - you guys are awesome! Thanks for a fun season! &lt;br/&gt;

While enjoying the wonderful feast orchestrated by David and Lynn Jesus, we spotted a huge number of birds for this time of year- more than the last 3 days totals combined! The Red-tails were especially productive today- and we saw lots of dark morphs, including an adult Harlan's Hawk! We also enjoyed watching the 9 Peregrine Falcons, which had no trouble in the wind even as we struggled to remain upright. Other highlights included two Red-shouldered Hawks and three Northern Harriers. What a wonderful day to end my hawkwatch season; thank you to everyone who made this year special for me! &lt;br/&gt;

The view from Hawk Hill was surreal - a sea of fog stretched out below us in all directions for most of the day. We could just see the tips of the Golden Gate Bridge towers and Sutro Tower resting atop the foggy ocean until around 12:30 when the fog cleared a bit and we finally saw our first birds! Though the raptor flow was very slow today, we had a wonderful potluck that kept us occupied while we watched the empty skies. Thanks for an awesome season Tuesday II!! &lt;br/&gt;

Ironically, the day started off foggy everywhere except on the top of Hawk Hill, which caused us some amusement. Hawkwatch volunteers enjoyed an assortment of pies and delighted in the great views of juvenile Northern Harriers. We also got a great look at a Merlin released from Hawk Blind. Other treats included large flocks of American Robins, a group of Western Bluebirds, and swirling columns of White-throated Swifts and Violet-green Swallows.  &lt;br/&gt;

Fortunately some hawks blew our way with more birds than there have been lately. Highlights included an adult Red-shouldered Hawk that flew directly over volunteers as it was harassed by two Common Ravens. Thrills and chills were experienced when an adult Peregrine also flew overhead as well. Another quality sighting was a dark morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawk that flew around from the south quadrant past volunteers and into the north. An excellent way to end the season for the Saturday I Team!&lt;br/&gt;

The raptors didn't seem to appreciate the break from yesterday's rain, though. Numbers were low, but the day began and ended with sightings of Swainson's Hawks, which are always exciting sights to see. A handful of American Kestrels, a few Northern Harriers, and an Osprey also kept us on our toes. Let's hope the beautiful weather continues and brings with it another push of hawks later this week. Stay tuned...&lt;br/&gt;

The weather slowly progressed into cold and overcast with a threat of rain and strong winds from the south. Though today was slow, we still saw several Red-tails and a handful of Peregrine Falcons. The highlight of the day was seeing a couple of adult Peregrines race around Hawk Hill - one zoomed right next to the west platform and gave us a great view without binoculars. During the slower times, the Ravens kept us entertained, gathering in unkindnesses* of 12 or more and barrel rolling through the sky. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Unkindness: n., a group of ravens.&lt;br/&gt;

When the winds finally came in the early afternoon, we had a huge peak of Red-tailed Hawk activity. We saw 100 juvenile Red-tailed Hawks today! One of the Red-tails that we saw was a light morph adult Harlan's type, and provided a nice challenge for the hawkwatchers. We also saw a dark morph juvenile Swainson's Hawk above Kirby Cove, which gave us a great view. We also had some very nice Peregrine Falcon sightings today, along with a lot of Northern Harriers.  &lt;br/&gt;

We also spotted a mysterious dark-backed buteo flying low over the water in the last half hour ... A kettle of 9 or so Turkey Vultures formed a couple of times to the north and Red-tails kept us entertained throughout the day. &lt;br/&gt;

The day started out pretty rapidly with a juvenile Bald Eagle sighting as the first bird of the day. The Bald flew right over Hawk Hill and commenced soaring; an angry adult Peregrine soon joined it. Not long after, a juvenile Swainson's Hawk flew right by the hill. We had 10 species before we had completed the first hour, which might be a new record! Today was a great day for Peregrine and Merlin sightings, and we also saw quite a few White-tailed Kites and Northern Harriers. Although the hawks slowed down towards the end of the day, we were treated to another rare sight- a Golden Eagle circling by the FM towers. Definitely one of the most memorable days this season!&lt;br/&gt;

One of the dark morphs, an adult, had a really interesting "tiger-barred" tail. At one point, we had three ethereal White-tailed Kites soaring together over the pines. Overall, a great day, even if it ended pretty slowly. &lt;br/&gt;

The highlights for today were the Osprey cruising over the lagoon and the three White-tailed Kites we saw around noon. We saw a lot of juvenile Red-tailed Hawks today, including some dark morphs, and a male American Kestrel gave us a show hovering over Hawk Blind. A good day overall. &lt;br/&gt;

We saw a slow dribble of hawks throughout most of the day, but only 19 individuals were counted in the last hour and a half. Winds were out of the south in the morning, but switched to west, then northwest in the afternoon. Highlights of the day included two Merlins, two Red-shouldered Hawks, and two American Kestrels. Hopefully numbers will pick up before the weather takes a turn for the worse. &lt;br/&gt;

However, the raptors seemed to have forgotten to set their clocks back; numbers were low for what seemed like good conditions, with winds from the north for most of the day. We spotted a handful of White-tailed Kites, some American Kestrels, the regular Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures, and a pair of Peregrine Falcons that soared over the hill almost the entire day, wowing us with their acrobatic stunts. They even dove on an unsuspecting Red-tail, which immediately high-tailed it out of the area. With this weird weather, who knows what tomorrow will bring? &lt;br/&gt;

Despite the blustery weather, we enjoyed seeing 2 White-tailed Kites - one right over Hawk Hill! - and nice views of Peregrine Falcons. Both the adult Peregrines and adult Red-tails were observed defending their territories throughout the day. A dark ominous cloud moved toward us from Mt. Tam as we retreated from Hawk Hill, but stunning skies and great company made for a nice day. &lt;br/&gt;

Though a bit brisk with a north-westerly wind, the skies were clear allowing Hawkwatchers to see FIVE eagles, a few White-tailed Kites, and some Northern Harriers. It was also remarkable that 15 Peregrine Falcons were seen, including the bridge pair that were seen calling and defending the territory in Kirby Cove from intruding migrants! There was also a sighting of a 14th species, a Short-eared Owl that flew over volunteers ending the day with another great raptor.&lt;br/&gt;

Though Hawkwatchers were unable to see it through the fog, Eddie Bartley of the banders reported a sighting of a Goshawk early in the day and the volunteers who returned to the office were able to see the telemetry bird, a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk, before its release this afternoon!&lt;br/&gt;

We saw a total of eleven species, including two White-tailed Kites, a number of juvenile Northern Harriers, and a Merlin that perched in a tree for over an hour in full view of our west quadrant. We once again had some great sightings of adult accipiters, and a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk made an appearance, taking a quick trip through Kirby Cove before heading back to the north.  &lt;br/&gt;

We also saw tons of Red-tailed Hawks, some of which showed very interesting color morphs. Still no sign of our first Rough-legged Hawk of the season- perhaps tomorrow will be the day!  &lt;br/&gt;

However, we did get a few treats- an adult Harlan's Hawk crossing the Golden Gate Bridge. Also, a beautiful tundrius juvenile Peregrine Falcon flew right in front of the north platform.

We saw more than one kettle of 10 or so Red-tailed Hawks - it seems like the second Red-tail peak has arrived. We also got some great views of several juvenile Northern Harriers and a brief glimpse of a juv. Bald Eagle towards Mt. Tam! Peregrine Falcons and White-tailed Kites also made an appearance today. With clear skies and perfect temperatures, today's hawkwatchers had an ideal day! &lt;br/&gt;

With literally dozens of falcons, 4 White-tailed Kites, 17 Northern Harriers (one of which was captured by HAWK blind and released for an ID study, the first NOHA for the banders this season) an adult Ferruginous Hawk that appeared low over the pines beyond the south and west platforms, a Broad-winged Hawk, and many more magnificent birds were seen from Hawk Hill. Megan led an educational program for a group of excited kindergarteners on the lower platform when an adult Peregrine Falcon took a tremendous stoop on a juvenile right above them- tearing through the pine trees, talons blazing, and both birds shrieking with gusto. The capstone to the day was a juvenile Bald Eagle that made an appearance right at 3:25 in the north saddle making the Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vulture in the same kettle look like accipiters. The eagle then proceeded to cross the bay into San Francisco over Crissy Field ending the day on a high note with a total of 13 species!&lt;br/&gt;

The morning was a little slow, but we were awed by an adult Peregrine aggressively diving and "kekking" at juvenile Peregrine over Hawk Blind. We went on to see 6 more Peregrines throughout the day, including a tundrius juvenile! We also had a great run of Merlins today, including one who gave us quite a show snacking on dragonflies. We also enjoyed watching four White-tailed Kites sail through the skies, along with some gorgeous dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks. &lt;br/&gt;

Clear skies with a light breeze from the NE made for a nice hawkwatching day.

We also saw 11 Merlins, 15 adult Sharp-shinned Hawks, and 13 adult Cooper's Hawks. We have been seeing a lot of diversity from Hawk Hill lately! If you're looking at the skies, look closely at any raptors you see - it may be something other than your local light-morph Red-tail or Turkey Vulture! &lt;br/&gt;

The morning was very busy and windy, but when the winds died down around noon and so did the corresponding numbers of hawks. However, we saw a good amount of species today. Some of our favorites were the beautiful male Northern Harrier flying high overhead, a gorgeous Osprey rising from the rifle range, and a couple of Merlins enjoying a tasty snack of dragonflies above the pines. Altogether a great day, even if we got a little sunburned!&lt;br/&gt;

The afternoon cleared the skies enough to allow volunteers up on Hawk Hill, but variable fog conditions left Hawkwatch volunteers in suspense with accipiters and kestrels emerging from the swirling whiteness. The real highlight of the afternoon was the brilliant plumage of a juvenile dark morph Broad-winged Hawk!&lt;br/&gt;

On our way back up the trail, Red-tails were being bombed left and right. First by a male American Kestrel and then another by a pair of Peregrine Falcons. &lt;br/&gt;

It was overcast with high clouds, yet the temperature was perfect. Though this weather was ideal for hawk watching, the hawks seemed to disagree with it and trickled through the headlands lazily. A highlight of the day was a dark morph juvenile Red-tail that circled closely around Hawk Hill twice, just to let us know a second time that he was indeed a dark morph.&lt;br/&gt;

We hiked around the lagoon and up Miwok trail and saw a great deal of fog. In addition to the fog migration, we saw a couple of Red-tailed Hawks - one (a rufous morph) was perched and eating lunch, and the other was diving to grab some lunch. We also heard a loud call coming from the marshy area off of Miwok trail, which we think may have been a Rail. &lt;br/&gt;

Highlights of the day included a brief sighting of a Merlin, four Osprey cruising through, and a Northern Harrier hanging out over Slacker Hill.

However, the day still proved fruitful with 30 Turkey Vultures, 13 Red-tailed Hawks, 5 Red-shouldered Hawks, and one each of an Opsrey, a Northern Harrier, and a Cooper's Hawk. We also saw a flock of Black Swifts, as well as some very adorable Blue-gray Gnatcatchers. Hopefully we'll have more time with the birds next cycle!  &lt;br/&gt;

Unfortunately we were unable to get up to Hawk Hill today.

We ate lunch at the Annex with hopes of skies clearing in the afternoon. Despite the never-ending wall of white, we spotted an adult Red-tailed Hawk fly through the valley below the Annex only to disappear moments later. &lt;br/&gt;

We also got some good looks at our Kirby Cove Red-tailed Hawk pair. I'm beginning to think we should change Hawk Hill's name into "Fog Hill," and the GGRO into the "Golden Gate Fog Observatory." Better luck next time!&lt;br/&gt;

Our most exciting raptor encounter came around 1:00, when one of the adult Peregrines, calling like crazy, stooped upon a Cooper's Hawk who quickly dropped into the safety of the trees. It's really too bad the fog insisted on hanging around the hill today!&lt;br/&gt;
