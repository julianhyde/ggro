<p>Today was freeeeeezing cold, but Sunday 2 pushed through and ended the season with a subadult Golden Eagle! Overall, the winds were moderate but chilly and the skies were clear of both clouds and for the most part, hawks. We had a wonderful season and feel it only fit to have ended on such a splendid bird! See you next year! <br/>

<p>Hawks? What hawks? Friday 2 had a wonderful potluck but unfortunately, few birds to end the season. We were happy to see that one of the bridge Peregrine falcons was back. The weather was cold with a low of 47 degrees, but it was a clear day and we were able to see out to the Farallon Islands! Friday 2 is sad that this was the last day but  is excited for the 2014 season!<br/>

<p>We thought that the weather was going to be frigid up on Hawk Hill today but it ended up being surprisingly pleasant! We had 0-10 mph winds out of the SE all day with temperatures in the high 40's to mid 50's. There were points in the day where the skies were empty but fear not - we did not get bored - there was oodles of delicious food! Today was a great send off for the Thursday II team!<br/>

<p>It was a somewhat slow day, but we had nice weather and pretty clouds. Winds were slow and mostly from the north. A merlin breezing by at the beginning of the count was a nice highlight, as was a close view of a dark morph juvenile red-tail. We had a great time and an unbelievable potluck for the last Tuesday II!<br/>

<p>Today started off really foggy, but we had a potluck to pass the time. Following a flash sighting of the mystical all-white Red-tailed Hawk, the fog suddenly vanished. Coincidence? I think not. Overall, we had a pretty good final day with many Red-tailed Hawk sightings and a guest appearance from a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk. The temperature started out warm, but a cool breeze picked up towards the end of the day. <br/>

<p>Today was an outstanding day because we saw an albino Red-tailed Hawk! It is completely pure white, and we followed from Mt. Tamalpais to angel Island until it finally looped back and disappeared into Sausalito. Some other perks were several Merlins, a few dark Red-tailed Hawks, and some Harriers. The weather was hot hot hot hot December and the skies were clear.<br/>

<p>Today was a beautiful day on Hawk Hill but unfortunately there were not many raptors. There was little to no wind with temperatures ranging from 64-75 degres Fahrenheit. With only 6 species we didn't see anything too spectacular although we had some great views of Wren tits and White-throated swifts. All in all this was a great season for the Saturday I team!<br/>

<p>It was unseasonably warm for this late in November, with temperatures almost reaching 80 degrees fahrenheit in the afternoon. Accompanied by nearly 500 visitors, we enjoyed the diversity of raptors seen from the hill today, including the turkey vultures (coming out on top with 113), red-tailed hawks (second with 101), and a smattering of late-season accipiters. Of course, I am contractually obliged to mention the juvenile bald eagle we watched circling over the lagoon (accompanied by five turkey vultures) as well as that awesome moment where we saw three dark-morph adult red-tails in the sky at the same time.<br/>

<p>It was a beautiful day with mostly east northeast winds which became west later in the day. It was relatively slow, but we saw a very pretty dark morph adult red-tail and some nice views of peregrines and adult accipiters. There was great food and a fun last day for Thursday I!<br/>

<p>Another slow, tail-end-of-the-season-type of day on Hawk Hill, with winds picking up speed throughout the day and temperatures in the 50's. The raptor highlight of the day was a beautiful adult peregrine falcon, giving us a great look as it circled in Kirby Cove. The non-raptor highlights include ravens playing with sticks, the interns' inventions of new hawk species (including the yellow-headed aplomado ferruginous-backed falcon and the American gyrvulture), and a delicious potluck feast by all of the volunteers. Thanks for a great season, Tuesday I!<br/>

The season is slowing down, but we did see some nice looking birds, such as a juvenile Bald Eagle and several dark morph Red-tailed Hawks. We were sad to wrap up the season, but are looking forward to next year!<br/>

<p>The 2013 season is definitely winding down, but we're still getting some sweet birds - like today's adult Ferruginous Hawk! We also had a lot of Red-tailed Hawks, some of which were dark morphs. It was a beautiful and warm fall day on the hill with winds from the southeast.<br/>

<p>Today begain with similar windiness to the previous two days, but the winds died down after the first couple of hours and we had a sunny, clear day on the hill. In the morning we had pretty steady red-tail activity, but the count slowed significantly in the afternoon, with only 52 birds in the final hour and a half. In the words of some hawkwatchers, we found ourselves "dredging" for birds. Nonetheless, 366 raptors is a pretty good count for this late in the season, especially when accompanied by an assortment of dark chocolates.<br/>

The raptor highlight of the day was a sub-adult bald eagle that came in far from the west - but certain members of the team would argue that the actual highlight was a flock of tundra swans that flew right over Hawk Hill!<br/>

The team got a good look at a juvenile Rough-legged Hawk during the first hour, as well as an adult Peregrine Falcon that was almost close enough to touch. Other raptors of note include a Golden Eagle and four dark morph Red-tails, three juveniles and an adult. Migratory Varied Thrushes and American Robins were also spotted in the AM.<br/>

A dark morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawk with a single white tail feather was also an interesting sight. Overall, though, the flight was quite slow and we were pushed off the hill early by fog and cold weather. The temperature was in the 60's and the wind was low but chilly!<br/>

Three golden eagles and one bald eagle were seen, including a very close look at a golden eagle rising over the south quadrant. We also had nice views of a couple peregrines and a merlin. A beautiful, very light-colored juvenile red-tail flew over Kirby Cove, and we suspect that it may have been a Harlan's Hawk. <br/>

<p>You know it's a day to remember when you overhear long-time hawkwatchers discussing whether or not this is "the slowest migration-season day ever." By the time noon rolled around, we had counted a measly 22 raptors, only three different species. The afternoon winds brought us some nice diversity, however, including an osprey flying across the ocean, and a juvenile Swainson's hawk flying south through the city. We ended the day with a respectable species count of 10, and a total count of 98 raptors, 16.33 hawks per hour. Thankfully, the ravens stepped up to keep us entertained today, performing great feats of balance on the wire fence in the south quadrant.<br/>

<p>We had a very slow day on the hill today, barely breaking 100 total sightings. A very close juvenile Bald Eagle sighting made up for this, though -- it flew over the North platform and circled for a long time. Another highlight was a close adult Peregrine Falcon that shot low beneath us and popped up again above the Golden Gate Bridge. The weather was cool in the low 60's for most of the day, and we had a few chilly breezes throughtout the day. <br/>

Unfortunately the flight tapered down throughout the day and we ended up with a 36 Hawks-per-hour total rate of sightings. The aforementioned species were definitely the highlights of the day, though we had a few nice male American Kestrel sightings.

<p>It was a nice clear day today, with north/northeast winds. The morning and late afternoon were relatively slow, but we had a flurry of red-tails coming through the valley towards the middle of the day. These included quite a few beautiful dark morph adults, and one rufous morph. We also got to see three ferruginous hawks, including the first adult of the season! The adult came very close right into Kirby Cove. We also had a nice look at a rough-legged hawk over the lagoon. <br/>

<p>It was a beautiful day, with great species diversity. Conditions were clear with a light breeze. Red-tails and turkey vultures trickled through slowly but steadily. Accipiter activity has slowed down, but we enjoyed two excellent highlights- a subadult (most likely fourth year) bald eagle passed over Angel Island and allowed great views. Its head was almost completely white, and the tail was white with brown inner rectrices. We also had nice looks at a rough-legged hawk, which was either an adult female or a juvenile. <br/>

Highlights included a fair number of dark morph red-tails, one dark morph broad-winged hawk, and a "gray ghost" (adult male harrier). We thought all of this was quite fitting for Halloween. :) At the end of the day we also spotted a distant golden eagle.  <br/>

Visibiltiy was great throughout the day with temperatures in the high 60's and slight winds from the ESE. Like yesterday, we saw a large number of ravens, but we also saw all four falcons!

It seemed like a fairly average flight, with American Kestrels as the most notable species sighted. The temperatures were low and the wind almost blew us off the hill by the end of the day...the plethora of hoods, scarves, and beanies--along with the screaming wind--made it a little difficult to hear each other's calls.<br/>

<p>Another foggy morning, but Wednesday II was not about to have their hopes of hawkwatching dashed. We followed the trend of the previous days and took a walk around Rodeo Lagoon this morning, seeing a number of sparrows, warblers, and waterfowl. Highlights include a pair of Wilson's snipes and a Bonaparte's gull. Around noon, we headed up to Hawk Hill and spent the next 2.25 hours counting. Through the fog, we counted some large kettles of Red-tailed Hawks, with the occassional accipiters thrown in. By 1:30, we were pretty much completely enshrouded again. With patches of visibility coming and going, we continued counting what we could see until we finally called it quits at 2:30.<br/>

<p>Despite a foggy beginning, we had a good few hours counting on the hill. Conditions cleared enough to count by 12, with a northwest wind. There was a flurry of activity as the fog cleared, including some kettles of red-tails and turkey vultures. There was a nice flow of accipiters as well. Also of note- during the fogged-in morning, we had some great bird sightings around the lagoon. Highlights included Wilson's snipe, fox sparrow, pectoral sandpiper, black-bellied plovers, ring-necked duck, ruddy duck, horned grebe, and golden- and ruby-crowned kinglets. To top it off, we ran into a bobcat eating a dead deer at the edge of the lagoon. <br/>

<p>We were fogged out today, but started the morning with a wonderful stroll around Rodeo Lagoon, where we saw a number of American Coots, Snowy and Great Egrets, Great Blue Herons, a pair of Ring Necked Ducks, several Mallards, and the usual complement of White-crowned, Golden-crowned, Song, and now Fox Sparrows. Out on the beach, the highlight was a pair of Surf Scoters. We got up to the annex just in time to see some clearing there, but Hawk Hill stayed obscured in typical fashion until it was time to leave. Even though we didn't count them, we did still get to see several Merlins, Kestrels, Red-shouldered Hawks, and one Broad-winged Hawk along with a fair number of Red-tailed Hawks and accipiters. <br/>

<p>The count wasn't too bad today, considering the foggy conditions! There was low fog below us for most of the day, which rose higher during the afternoon. We had some nice views of adult accipiters, and quite a few harriers. Towards the end of the day, some large mixed kettles (which included red-tails, turkey vultures, and a few broad-wings) were hanging out in the east. <br/>

<p>Today flight was slow and mostly speck birds, but Saturday I pushed through and counted them all! The weather was warm with slight winds, though not enough to push more birds out way it seems. We did get a decent amount of adult accipiters though, and many of our team members were able to work on accipiter ID.<br/>

<p>Todays flight picked up at around 10:30 AM and stayed pretty consistent throughout the day. The weather was in the 70's and a light breeze picked up towards the end of the day. The highlight of the day was a leucistic adult Red-tailed hawk! It had brilliant white shoulders, but was otherwise normal and hung around the Slacker area for at least 5 minutes. We also saw a good deal of Merlins and Northern Harriers, including an adult female, which is a rarity on Hawk Hill!<br/>

<p>What happened to peak season? Today was unsually slow for this time of year, and we found ourselves looking at ravens or empty skies for most of the day. We did get a few goods views of some birds though, for example, several Red-shouldered Hawks, accipters, a Broadwinged Hawk, and a Purple Martin. Overall the weather was a little muggy, with low cloud cover and intermittent fog. We hope for more birds next time!<br/>

As usual, there were Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vulutres apleanty, and towards the end of the day, a Raven carrying a peanut-butter and jelly sandwhich was sighted as well.<br/>

<p>Today was slow at the start, slow at the finish, with a flurry of raptor activity in the middle. The day was sunny and the wind direction was "all," seeming to change every three minutes or so. We were hopeful to get a look at the vagrant Blue-footed Booby, spotted just across the bay at 10AM today (thank you, eBird!) However, the raptors certainly kept our attention today. We got a good look at a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk, followed by an even better look at its adult counterpart, a great lesson in distinguishing the two. Towards the end of the day, a distant dot was identified as a Ferruginous Hawk of unknown age. As for our usual suspects, the Turkey Vulutures beat out the Red-tailed Hawks by one bird today, 94-95.<br/>

<p>We had a strong start to the day with a juvenile Golden Eagle sighting only 20 minutes into our count. This, however, was trumped and made to seem mundane by our 2:20 PM sighting of A DARK-MORPH FERRUGINOUS HAWK! The Ferruginous Hawk came in from Mt. Tamalpais with a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk and flew lazily over our heads, giving us a GREAT view.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a great and fog-free day. Today was slow, but had a steady stream of raptors to keep us occupied. Accipiters are definitely starting to come in, though not in huge numbers yet. By the way, today had the record number of species for the season! <br/>

<p>Today started out foggy but cleared out quite nicely and led to the record number or species so far this season with total of 11. Some highlights of the day were seeing several Broad-winged Hawks and Red-Shouldered Hawks. We also had a nice view of a dramatic day for the America's Cup races -- the New Zealand boat almost capsized! Overall, it was a slow and steady day and we look forward to the oncoming rush of accipiters!<br/>

<p>The team had great weather and great birds today, with three falcon species and 2 Broad-winged Hawks!  One Broad-wing flew directly overhead, giving the team a great look.  They also watched several Sharp-shinned Hawks going after Cooper's Hawks - feisty accipiters tussling in the sky made for a good show. Docent programs continue this weekend, with noon Hawk Talks and 1pm Banding Demos on both Saturday and Sunday - be sure to leave plenty of time to park and walk up if you plan to attend, as parking is limited and fills up fast. Lots of non-raptors are moving through too - visit the Visitor's Center to pick up a map if you'd like to park and hike up while birding! <br/>

<p>We got up to the hill and started our count at 11 o'clock sharp this morning and got in a solid 4.5 hours of counting despite the fog creeping in and out throughout the day. The highlights: we caught a glimpse of the first Merlin of the season, a good look at an adult dark-morph Red-tailed Hawk, and a few adult accipiters. The weather stayed relatively warm, and overall, we had quite a pleasant day. <br/>

<p>It was a relatively slow day today demonstrated by our brief celebration at 3:00 when the count reached 100 raptors. Overcast with a light breeze, we mostly saw the usual: Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures (no Cooper's Hawks counted today!). There was some nice movement of non-raptor migrants ("tweety birds" as some hawkwatchers call them) to keep us occupied as well, including flocks of 23 White-throated Swifts, 20 Band-tailed Pigeons, and 15 Cedar Waxwings.<br/>

<p>We got up to the hill this morning around 9:45 this morning, breaking above the thick layer of fog to find a beautiful sunny hill from which to conduct our count. The lack of wind for most of the morning may have contributed to a slightly slower morning, but when it finally picked up around noon, the Red-tailed Hawks started to arrive en masse, teasing us in several large, shifting kettles that bounced back and forth for several hours between the West and the South quadrants. We also got a good long view at a Prairie Falcon that came out of the North and took off south across the Golden Gate. The fog chased us off the hill just before 2 pm, when we ended our count and packed up for warmer climes. It should be noted, however, that we did have great views of the Mt. Diablo fire while the sky was open. <br/>

<p>We thought that today was going to be a scorcher but the wind picked up around 1 to make it a beautiful day up on Hawk Hill. The high was 88 degrees with great visibility that lasted all day. The highlight was the two Golden Eagles (1 subadult and 1 juvenile) that flew by within minutes of each other. We saw our usual plethora of Red-tailed hawks and Turkey vultures, but we were also lucky enough to see 2 Osprey, a couple of Northern Harriers and a few kestrels.

<p>Friday I is proud to announce the first eagle sighting of the season: a juvenile Golden Eagle soaring around the North and South Slacker peaks! It hung around long enough for everyone to look at it through a spotting scope if they so pleased, and boy, we were pleased! We also got some great up-close and personal views with an osprey and a dark morph adult and juvenile Red-tailed Hawk. Overall it was a beautiful. clear, and hot day on the hill. Indeed peak is on its way, and we are getting giddy!<br/>

<p>It was a beautiful, clear day with some great sightings! Many red-tails and turkey vultures passed, with a good number of accipiters. These included both Cooper's hawks and sharp-shinned hawks. We also saw a few red-shoulders, kestrels, peregrines, an osprey, and two prairie falcons! This was certainly the highlight of the day - we saw some great stooping behavior from one of the birds before it flew up over Hawk Hill and stilled for a moment. This allowed us to have excellent views of the bird!<br/>

<p>It's hard to say what was more exciting for the hawkwatchers today: spotting the first Broad-winged Hawk of the season (a second-year showing significant molt and a mixed tail), the dark-morph Broad-wing that puzzled us for nearly a half-hour, the 3 dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks that flew by between 12 and 2, or the 58 Turkey Vultures (okay, it probably wasn't the vultures). With clear skies, temperatures consistently in the 70's, and the great company of Wednesday I hawkwatchers, today was ideal. Additional highlights include an Osprey flying low below the Golden Gate Bridge and a Cooper's Hawk and Sharp-shinned Hawk flying together to offer apprentice watchers a chance easily to compare the two species. We hope today was indicative of the great migration season to come!<br/>

<p>Despite it being another thoroughly foggy day on the hill, the Monday 1 team pushed through and counted for a few hours anyway. In the clear windows between sheets of fog, we were able to see up to 5 juvenile Red-tailed Hawks at once within a single binocular field. We also picked up a single juvenile Cooper's Hawk in the distance. There has been talk of a few early Sharp-shinned hawk sightings in the valley, so we are excitedly waiting for our chance to count them from the hill!<br/>

<p>PEA SOUP. Eventually went up to the Annex to see if we could wait out the fog on the hill, but visibility wavered between poor and dismal and we really only caught glimpses of two juvenile Red-Tailed Hawks and a few Turkey Vultures. Allen began an informal Hawk Talk for the crew down at the Annex and twice managed to mistakenly write on his dry-erase board with a permanent marker--definitely a highlight of the day. Good conversation, pleasant enough weather, but no birds.<br/>

Optimistic of its eventual clearing, we birded for a couple hours, getting looks at a couple accipiters, numerous turkey vultures, and an adult red-tailed hawk making territorial swoops on a raven right over our heads. By 1:00, the fog on Hawk Hill had only managed to get thicker, so we had to call off the count for the day.<br/>

Turkey Vultures were also active over the rifle range; at one point we saw 7 circling low over the ground in the same area. We are excited to see more species as the season progresses!<br/>
