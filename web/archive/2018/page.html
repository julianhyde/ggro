<h2><a name='20181202'/>Sunday, December 02, 2018</h2>
<p>Clear and sunny skies welcomed the Sunday 2 team for the final Hawkwatch day of the 2018 season! Throughout the day we enjoyed watching Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, and Cooper's Hawks fly around the Headlands. The team also got a good look at a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk as it flew around and perched in a distant tree  the first Red-shouldered to be spotted in a while! The day concluded with a Peregrine Falcon flying fast around the hill and into the sunset  a lovely end to a lovely day and season of Hawkwatching! Thank you to all the volunteers old and new who make our work at the GGRO possible, and we look forward to seeing everyone on Hawk Hill again in 2019! <br/>

<p>Today was a beautiful last day on Hawk Hill for Friday II. After so many days of smoke and rain, we felt lucky that the weather was in our favor. Although it was a bit of a slow day, we had some great looks at juvenile and adult Peregrine Falcons that flew close to the hill and impressed us with their graceful stooping. We had a lot of adult Red-tailed Hawk activity and heard a few fighting and calling at each other. Although the flight of raptors has decreased with the end of the migration season, we had a wonderful last day on the Hill. We're all looking forward to next year. <br/>

<p>Capricious weather conditions prevented the Thursday 2 team from getting any Hawkwatching in today. Though the skies seemed as if they would clear and the team attempted to get out on the hill, we were flushed out by the heavy rains and strong winds! Nevertheless, the team had a wonderful last day hanging out with each other and eating some delicious food back at the office. We look forward to better weather and more Hawkwatching next season! <br/>

<p>Despite a forecast for rain, Wednesday 2 ended up with a short but sweet day up on Hawk Hill. We started our count with a juvenile Peregrine Falcon flying fast around the hill. Northern Harriers, Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and an American Kestrel also made appearances. We got a great look at a pair of Turkey Vultures (one of which was our tagged friend #368!) sunning themselves on nearby rocks, and an exciting look at two adult Peregrines chasing an adult Red-tailed. Overall, the short day out in the sun was a great way to wrap up the season!  <br/>

<p>Tuesday II spent the last day having a great time enjoying food at the office since rain has kept the team off the hill. While we are sad that we were unable to make it up to the hill for the last day, we had an amazing season with highlights of 5 Eagles in one day, 2 Rough-legged Hawks, and a light Harlan's Red-tail Hawk. We are looking forward to a sunnier Hawkwatch next season!!<br/>

<p>Fighting falcons! The Monday II Hawkwatch team wrapped up the season with some amazing looks at adult Peregrines and male American Kestrels diving on one another around Hawk Hill. Despite the low number of Accipiters, the group enjoyed close views of Northern Harriers hunting and Red-tailed Hawks soaring. A midday Ferruginous Hawk flew directly by the Hill, showing off the trademark 3 points of light field mark  white on the upperside of both wings and at the base of the tail. Overall, a fantastic finish to an excellent season for the team!<br/>

<p>The last Sunday 1 of the season started very slow, with only a handful of birds spotted in the first couple hours. Our team's patience was rewarded, however, with excellent looks at a Bald Eagle and Ferruginous Hawk later in the afternoon! Numerous Red-tailed Hawks also graced the Hill with their presence today, along with the usual Turkey Vultures and a few Accipiters. We saw an unusually low number of falcons today (just two American Kestrels, all day!) but hope more will be seen in the coming days. While a slow day overall, it was a nice way to end the season for Sunday 1!<br/>

<p>It was wonderful day on the hill for Saturday 1! Though early fog prevented us from getting a full day on the hill, the team persisted and eventually got some great views of Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, and a couple of adult Accipiters. It was also a great day for falcons, as the team got good looks at adult Peregrines, American Kestrels (including one carrying some prey!), and a Merlin perching on a nearby rock. Today was also our fearless Dayleader Bob Power's last day leading the team on Hawk Hill  thank you Bob, for a fantastic 15 years of Hawkwatching! <br/>

<h2><a name='20181122'/>Thursday, November 22, 2018</h2>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving from Thursday I! Today was a gorgeous day on Hawk Hill and marked the first time Hawkwatch has been able to count in two weeks. Today's raptor activity was a bit slow and we ended early due to the holiday, but the hours we did spend Hawkwatching were very worthwhile. One of the best moments of the day was watching a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk stilling over the Hill get stooped on by an adult Peregrine Falcon. The Red-tail dodged the Peregrine, but it continued to chase the Red-tail with acrobatic and effortless dives and was joined by another adult Peregrine (presumably its mate). Needless to say, the young Red-tail disappeared quickly. It was quite the show! A last minute and far off Rough-legged Hawk crossing the Golden Gate and heading south finished off our special day. It is great to be back in the field, and we are looking forward to the last week of the season!<br/>

We had an amazing season filled with lots of raptors, laughs, and we already can't wait till next year. We hope the air continues to improve during these last two weeks, and for everyone to get up to the Hill for their last Hawkwatch day. Till next time, Wednesday 1 out.<br/>

<p>Thursday 1 was blown away by the great birds seen at Hawk Hill today! The day started off with many Red-tailed Hawks, Northern Harriers, and Turkey Vultures dancing around in the 35 mph wind. A couple adult Accipiters also flew around the hill, giving the team a great look at their gray and rufous plumage. Activity picked up later in the morning when three juvenile Ferruginous Hawks showed up, with one that circled lazily above us for a few minutes. Although no Northern Goshawks were seen today, an adult female Rough-legged Hawk was spotted in Kirby Cove who was close enough to Hawk Hill that we were able to admire here striking carpal patches, belly band, and dark banded tail. We had a brief look at a juvenile Golden Eagle and a light-morph Harlan's Hawk, which made enduring the high-winds worthwhile. Unfortunately, we had to leave the hill early due to poor air quality from the fires in Butte County.  Our thoughts are with the communities being impacted by the fires, and we hope everyone stays safe and healthy. <br/>

<p>Today was a busy 13-species day with over 500 raptor sightings for the Wednesday 1 Hawkwatch team! The first bird spotted was an elusive gray ghost' (a male Northern Harrier) soaring above Slacker Ridge. An early male American Kestrel cruised around Hawk Hill, flashing blue-gray wings and dark malar stripes. Kettles of Red-tailed Hawks spiraled high into the sky, and flew over excited Hawkwatchers as they continued on to San Francisco. The day peaked when, around 1pm, the team witnessed an amazing array of six raptor species in under five minutes. First came two Sharp-shinned Hawks - one adult and one juvenile - catching thermals and rising up. Then we spotted two distant Red-shouldered Hawks, riding the wind along the coast. Suddenly, a sub-adult (~2 year-old) Bald Eagle popped up right in front of the team and winged its way north. Not a moment later, a Northern Goshawk rose up right under the sun and over our heads, joining a Cooper's Hawk and the Sharp-shinned Hawks in a rare kettle of all three Accipiter species! To top it all off, a dark-morph Red-tailed Hawk flew under the Accipiters and they all migrated south. The rest of the day did not disappoint, with good looks at White-tailed Kites, Peregrine Falcons, and a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk.<br/>

<p>Today was a beautiful day on Hawk Hill. We had six dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks throughout the day, and a look at an interesting Ferruginous Hawk who sported an unusual rufous-tipped tail. The undisputed highlight of the day, however, was a group of agitated Ravens seen flying low in Kirby Cove. The source of their consternation was a low flying juvenile Northern Goshawk! It was great to see the Goshawk dwarf a Cooper's Hawk that flew by in the same field of view. This raptor was likely (though not definitively) the same individual which was spotted yesterday, considering how few have been seen in the Marin Headlands. The last Goshawk seen from Hawk Hill was in 2015, so this bird was a real treat for our Hawkwatch team and especially for our Hawkwatch Manager Step Wilson, who first spotted the bird, making it his first Goshawk seen from Hawk Hill. Congrats, Step! <br/>

<p>Today was a special day for the Monday I Hawkwatching team. The day started out with large kettles of Red-tailed Hawks with a few beautiful dark morph RTs. A few Red-shouldered Hawks joined the mix, flying around Hawk Hill and toward San Francisco. Accipiters were spotted in smaller numbers but still made an appearance around the Headlands. Then, in the afternoon, the team was ridiculously lucky to get a look at a juvenile Northern Goshawk as it steadily flew to land on a rock between the North and East quadrants! The excited team spent the final hour on the Hill enjoying the sunny day and occasional raptor in the last hour of Hawkwatching.<br/>

<p>A pretty slow day on the Hill for Sunday 2, but not a bad one! We were challenged periodically by distant kettles of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures. Occasionally, a Northern Harrier would join the kettles to spice things up.  We also got some close visits by Peregrine Falcons and a few Sharp-shinned Hawks, but saw surprisingly few Cooper's Hawks today (only 2!). A Humpback Whale also spent over an hour feeding in the Golden Gate within full sight of our Hawkwatch team, which was a real treat. (The other treat we got to enjoy today was our pizza, earned last Sunday 2 for seeing the first Rough-legged Hawk of the season!) <br/>

<p>Saturday II Hawkwatch had a warm, slow start to the day with little wind and less than 15 raptors spotted in the first hour. Nevertheless, the team persisted and the wind picked up, bringing raptors by Hawk Hill and toward San Francisco. Some of the first birds to appear were dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks scattered in with their light-morph counterparts and a potential light Harlan's Red-tailed Hawk, which joined the distant kettle. While the number of Red-tailed Hawk sightings remained high, we have been seeing fewer and fewer Accipiters over the past week. The day ended on a high note with the team riveted by the sight of an adult male Harrier mobbing two juvenile Red-tailed Hawks.<br/>

<p>Today had a very slow start, but raptor activity eventually picked up as the day progressed. As is typical for this time of year, our number of Accipiters has decreased steadily and has made for emptier skies. We did have some nice looks at Merlins today, including one that buzzed by Hawk Hill two minutes before we ended our count. Besides a few close birds, the majority of our sightings were high and distant, giving us an added challenge in the identification process. Luckily, with the help of spotting scopes, lots of eyes, and decades of experience among our volunteers, we were able to pick up some special raptors, including Friday II's first Ferruginous Hawk of the year! <br/>

<p>A warm and wonderful day for Thursday 2! Almost immediately after beginning the count, the team got a magnificent look at a juvenile dark-morph Rough-legged Hawk that flew directly over Hawk Hill. Shortly after, a pair of Peregrine Falcons rose up from the hills and circled the team as well. As the day went on and the temperature rose, some nice thermals began to form. Red-tailed Hawks, including some beautiful dark-morphs, Red-shouldered Hawks, and Turkey Vultures all took advantage of the heat and formed great kettles for the team to look at. It was also a great day for Northern Harriers, and there was one sighting of a juvenile and an adult male hanging out together low over the hills. Two of our tagged Turkey Vultures were also spotted sunning themselves on a nearby rock.  Overall, it was a great day for Hawkwatching!<br/>

<p>Wednesday II had a Spooktacular Halloween up on Hawk Hill. We were haunted by Gray Ghosts, and dark-morph raptors dominated the skies, including an adult Rough-legged Hawk, a few Red-tailed Hawks and even a Swainson's Hawk. A brilliant Red-shouldered Hawk cast its heavenly glow upon us before we descended back into the shadows of small Sharp-shinned Hawks and Turkey Vultures. Peregrine Falcons cackled eerily around us. While the raptors were clearly trying to TRICK us with their befuddling field marks, it was a real TREAT to watch these special birds. Happy Hawk-o-ween!<br/>

<p>Tuesday 2 is so happy to have had the chance for another full day of Hawkwatching, and an exciting one at that! A fabulous day with sightings of Peregrine Falcons swooping on Red-tailed Hawks and Northern Harriers. Two Rough-legged Hawks came into view this morning as well, one a juvenile and another an adult. Early in the afternoon our team also had the amazing luck of seeing 5 eagles - 2 Golden Eagles and 3 Bald Eagles! Even our Red-tailed Hawk sightings today felt special, with good views of some beautiful dark-morph birds and two others doing a display flight over Kirby Cove. In non-raptor news, we also watched about a hundred Brant geese fly by the Hill today, in addition to the usual massive flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons that circle the Hill often these days. All things considered, a phenomenal day for Tuesday 2 Hawkwatch!<br/>

<p>Despite clear skies and lots of sun, the day started slowly at Hawkwatch today. In the first couple hours of counting, we saw mostly Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks but were excited when a few Red-shouldered Hawks appeared around the Hill. Midday, the wind picked up slightly and the team got good looks at a variety of Northern Harriers including an adult male, an adult female, and a juvenile hunting in the hills of the Headlands below Hawkwatch. An early afternoon Ferruginous Hawk made an appearance, spiraling upward in front of the Golden Gate Bridge before heading south toward San Francisco. Not an hour later, a second FEHA was spotted in the west, over 2 miles away! The final (falcon) hour included visits from a speeding Merlin, a fluttering male and female Kestrel, and a zooming Peregrine falcon  a fast and furious end to a slow-starting day.<br/>

<p>For the first time in over a month, Hawkwatch was completely fogged out! Due to the surprisingly late season fog, the morning was spent birding around the lagoon where the team saw some Yellowthroats, American Wigeons, a Hermit Thrush, and a Merlin. A group of river otters was also spotted hanging out in the water! Conditions seemed to be improving around mid-morning, but the fog kept coming and refused to leave the headlands. As the team left, a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk came through the fog wall and flew close overhead as if to say goodbye. We hope that this is the last foggy day of the season, and look forward to some actual hawk counting next time!<br/>

<p>Saturday 1 Hawkwatch started with low fog completely obscuring everything below the hill with clear skies above. It gave the team hope that the day would clear which it did late in the count. Even with the little wind we had, we got 10 species of birds. A Peregrine Falcon hung near the hill, allowing us a couple of good looks. We also saw several Merlins and some nice dark morph Red-tailed Hawks. An overall great day with some great sightings. <br/>

<p>Friday 1 Hawkwatch had a great time up on the Hill. Our day started off foggy but cleared early on and allowed for a full day of counting. One of our most unusual sightings was a flock of 30 Canada Geese that flew high overhead in a classic arrow formation. Today was a great day for Northern Harriers; we spotted juveniles and adult males in every hour of the day, with some coming close enough to admire their facial disks and the shocking gray plumage of the adult males, colloquially called Gray Ghosts. We also had two beautiful White-tailed Kites fly by, slow enough for us to marvel at their bright white, unique plumage. One of the juvenile Red-tailed Hawks that was color-banded through the GGRO banding program stilled for a few minutes in front of the hill, making it possible to take a picture and read the number off the band. We are looking forward to finding out the day the bird was banded!<br/>

<p>Thursday 1's Hawkwatch day started out foggy, but quickly cleared up making way for a beautiful day for counting. We had great sightings of two Osprey, Red-shouldered Hawks, and some Peregrine Falcons and Merlins. A few of our team members debated the possibility of identifying one Merlin as a Prairie Merlin (Falco columbarius richardsonii), a subspecies of Merlin that breeds in the prairies of Saskatchewan and Montana. This particular bird looked light in color and had strikingly thick, light tail bands, which is characteristic of the subspecies.  We saw quite a few Accipiters and a good number of them were adults. A great day at the hill, and we are hoping to have fair weather again next time. <br/>

<p>Wednesday I had gorgeous weather and 11 species of birds! Adult and juvenile Accipiters alike flew closely over the Hill, giving the team a great opportunity to appreciate differences in plumage. An Osprey popped up directly under the noses of the Hawkwatchers in the western quadrant close enough that we could see the white scalloping on the back feathers, indicating that it was a juvenile bird. Towards the end of the day we had a large influx of Merlins, which skyrocketed past the in groups of 2 and 3. A great day of Hawkwatching, and we are excited for more to come on Hawk Hill!<br/>

<p>Today was Tuesday II's second full day on the Hill, and we enjoyed it! Overall, there was not a huge flight of birds, but activity picked up in the afternoon and we had a nice diversity of species. A White-tailed Kite flew directly over Hawk Hill, allowing all of us to admire it. Early on in our day, an adult Peregrine Falcon rose up from the hills below, close enough to see individual feathers and startle some of our Hawkwatchers. In the afternoon, we were distracted by a far-off Ferruginous Hawk when a kettle of Red-tailed Hawks seemingly appeared out of nowhere on the other side of the Hill. Our day was completed by an afternoon Merlin hunting a butterfly. After three unsuccessful attempts, the Merlin flew off and the butterfly carried on. We're wishing both individuals a successful migration moving forward. Tuesday II is hoping for more clear days on Hawk Hill! <br/>

<p>Though the day started off slow underneath grey overcast skies, Sunday 2 ended up with a wonderful day with some very exciting sightings. The morning began with many Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, and Cooper's Hawks flying far off in the distance. As the day went on and the Headlands warmed up, more birds started flying closer overhead, including American Kestrels, Merlins, and a beautiful juvenile dark morph Red-tail. Later in the afternoon, the first Rough-legged Hawk of the season made an appearance flying low and close near Hawk Hill! The team got a great look at it before it flew off through the Headlands and towards the south. The day wrapped up with a fun look at an adult Red-tail perched on a rock just a couple yards away from Hawk Hill eating some freshly caught prey before it was chased off by some of the local ravens. Overall, it was a great day for Sunday 2 and we're excited to have seen the first Roughie of the 2018 season! <br/>

<p>Weather on the Hill was uncooperative and fickle today - a thin but obscuring layer of fog came in and out of the Headlands all day, making spotting and passing raptors very difficult. However, in a briefly clear window near noon, our team managed to spot plenty of Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, and both adult and juvenile Accipiters. A couple of Harriers and small Falcons also flew over in that same timeframe. Shortly thereafter, sadly, the wind picked back up and the fog surged back over the Hill closing our count down early. Though today wasn't nearly as busy as the last Saturday II, we are hopeful for more good days down the road! <br/>

A few juvenile Northern Harriers hung around most of the day, granting us the chance to watch their acrobatic flight behavior and see their unique plumage up close. Earlier in the day there was a nice stream of adult Accipiters, which trailed off as the afternoon progressed. Even in the hot sun, our small team carried on with great spirits.

<p>A slow start this Tuesday, but fortunately a full day of Hawkwatching (the first for Tuesday 2!). Clear skies greeted the team as we made our way up the Hill, but a layer of fog soon threatened to roll in off the ocean. Fortunately, shifting winds kept the fog largely away from us, giving us a chance to look at a good number of raptors. The star bird of the day was an incredible light-colored Harlan's Hawk that spent several minutes right above the heads of the Hawkwatchers! Other highlights included several adult Accipiters, close-flying American Kestrels, and all three subspecies of Merlin. All told, a very rewarding first day on the Hill for Tuesday 2! <br/>

<p>The Monday II team started the day at Hawk Hill with looks at adult Peregrine Falcons swooping overhead. American Kestrels, Merlins and additional Peregrine Falcons continued to make appearances throughout the morning. As the day progressed, the team spotted an adult Bald Eagle heading south along the coast. The count ended with kettles of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures spiraling upward around Hawk Hill. Overall, a beautiful sunny day with lots of raptors!<br/>

<p>Clear skies and a cool breeze made for an excellent Hawkwatching day! The morning started off with some good views of adult Accipiters as well as Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, and a fast-moving Merlin. Things picked up midday when we spotted three White-tailed Kites as well as a sub-adult Bald Eagle flying just south of the hill (special thanks to an observant visitor for pointing it out!). We were also treated to a delightful view of an adult Red-shouldered Hawk circling the hills. Later in the afternoon the team got an excellent look at two juvenile Ferruginous Hawks cruising lazily around the Headlands. Overall, it was another great day for Sunday 1! <br/>

<p>Foggy, windy, and chilly on Hawk Hill today! Though the Saturday 1 team put in a good effort, the fog won and we were only able to get an hour and a half of hawk watching in. However, we did get to watch a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk be released at the noon Hawk Talk and Raptor Release.  Despite the inclement weather and poor visibility, we were excited to celebrate World Migratory Bird Day with our team and this special hawk guest.

<p>Golden Hour came early on Hawk Hill today; between 1 and 2 pm we had four Golden Eagles, and a fourth year Bald Eagle! Today was a great day for Friday I, with sunny and clear skies that were filled with raptors. An adult Ferruginous Hawk flew low in front of the Golden Gate Bridge, giving us the chance to marvel at its rufous markings on its back and white underside. We also had a close sighting of a beautiful Peregrine Falcon hunting in the hills in front of us. The Peregrine sported a light gray back and a sandy brown tail and nearly resembled a Prairie Falcon. Considering these field marks, the bird was likely a juvenile Arctic Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus tundrius), a subspecies that nests in the tundra of Alaska and Northern Canada. We were lucky to have some cool non-raptorial species visit us on the hill as well, including a Rock Wren, hundreds of Violet-green Swallows, some Vaux's and White-throated Swifts, and two humpback whales out in ocean. We left the hill feeling very lucky, and a little sun-burnt from such a beautiful day!  <br/>

<p>Warm weather brought nice thermals to the Headlands, which means Thursday 1 had a great time looking at the high soaring hawks! The morning started off with an excellent look at a juvenile Broad-winged Hawk flying around next to an American Crow. Soon after, we started seeing Red-shouldered Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, American Kestrels, Cooper's Hawks, and Sharp-shinned Hawks soaring around the hill. The team got a good look at an adult Peregrine Falcon soaring overhead as well. As the weather got warmer, we had high kettles directly above Hawk Hill filled with a variety of different raptors, including a juvenile Swainson's Hawk! The day concluded with a close-up look at a Merlin as it circled the team before flying off to chase down some prey. Overall, it was a wonderful day for Thursday 1!<br/>

<p>Falcon fight! Lots of good looks at falcons today, including a Kestrel and Merlin dueling early in the morning and two Peregrines in aerial combat later in the afternoon. Our personal favorite was a Merlin that dove repeatedly after a Raven right over the heads of our Hawkwatchers - so close that we could hear it! We also had a late morning sighting of a vagrant Palm Warbler, which continued to make appearances around Hawk Hill throughout the rest of the day. An excellent day for birdwatching stories.<br/>

<p>A disappointing day for Tuesday I; we were foiled again by our nemesis, The Fog. We were able to count for an hour before suspending our count and ultimately leaving the Hill early. On the bright side, we were able to get great looks at the field marks on the 20 birds we counted because they were so close to the Hill! (Any other farther-flying birds were invisible to us.) However, the wind and fog were worth enduring as we were joined by the GGRO's wonderful director, Allen Fish, who also happened to be celebrating his birthday today. Happy birthday, Allen! Thanks for all that you do for our organization! <br/>

<p>Hundreds of butterflies soared overhead on Hawk Hill today, making Hawkwatching a bit challenging for the Monday I team. Despite the many flapping insects, the group quickly spotted Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks upon arriving to count. The Blue Angels made an early appearance, flying out over the Bay, to end their weekend in San Francisco. As the morning wore on, the Hawkwatchers spotted an adult Bald Eagle and later, a juvenile Golden Eagle (double eagle day!).

Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks danced around the hill as they were buffeted by the winds, while Red-tailed, Red-shouldered, and Broad-winged Hawks circled high above us. We also had some close-up views of a pair of adult Peregrines flying right over the team. The team also got an excellent view of a juvenile Swainson's Hawk flying right off the side of the hill, bringing our total count for Swainson's up to 3 for the season!

<p>The Blue Angels weren't the only ones putting on a show today! Beautiful clear skies and a nice breeze made for great Hawkwatching conditions, and the team had a fun challenge when multiple kettles of hawks started popping up in all directions. Groups of Cooper's Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, Red-shouldered Hawks, and Broad-winged Hawks circled high above Hawk Hill, taking advantage of the thermals forming from the warm weather. Turkey Vultures, including our tagged friend #368, also took advantage of the heat and soared around the Headlands. We also saw plenty of falcons  Kestrels, Merlins, and Peregrines were all spotted flying quickly overhead. The team also got great looks at some White-tailed Kites and Northern Harriers. Overall, Saturday II had an awesome day with the highest count of the season so far!<br/>

<p>Today was finally a beautiful day on the hill for Friday II! It was our first time getting an entire day out there, and our team was thrilled. We had a lot of close looks at a lot of great species, including a Broad-winged Hawk circling right above the hill and accompanied by an Osprey. A Merlin flew by close above us just minutes after we got up on the hill, and later in the afternoon an adult Red-tailed Hawk cried out its classic alarm call before stooping dramatically into Kirby Cove at an unseen threat. The raptors were not the only ones with impressive flight displays today, as the skies were also peppered with jets throughout the day who were practicing for this weekend's air shows, including the Blue Angels. <br/>A special thanks to the group of awesome volunteers who came out today to bulk up our team, considering it was especially small today! We appreciated the extra help and are very grateful. <br/><br/>

We still were able to see a Grey Ghost, a sub-adult Bald Eagle and an adult Peregrine! Towards the end the wind picked up and the raptors started to stream by. Happy to finally get out for longer than 2 hours. We hope the weather will continue to improve for our team and that we will have a full day next time. <br/>

<p>Undeterred by stormy forecasts, the Monday II team headed up to Hawk Hill for their second counting day of the season. The group was greeted by sunlight and visitors from the Mendocino Coast Audubon Society. A male Northern Harrier (grey ghost) was the first raptor to appear, soon followed by a steady stream of Accipiters and Red-tailed Hawks that continued throughout the day. Mid-morning, the team observed a couple Broad-winged Hawks kettling with other Buteos and Turkey Vultures in the distance. Shortly after that, a far Ferruginous Hawk sighting and a nearly vertical stoop from a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk drew excitement from the assembled Hawkwatchers. The day concluded with two Merlins in the sky (one nearly over the Hawkwatcher platform on Hawk Hill) and a total of 12 observed species.<br/>

Several other hawks, especially Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks, were flying high overhead today (and were at one point joined by a high-up Peregrine Falcon).

<p>Grey clouds hung low over the headlands this morning, but that did not deter Saturday 1 from getting up on the hill. Thankfully, the weather stayed mild throughout the day, allowing us to get good looks at American Kestrels, Red-tailed Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, and Cooper's Hawks. Early on in the day we also had some close looks at a pair of adult Peregrines and a White-tailed Kite hanging around the hill. Distant Red-shouldered Hawks and Broad-winged Hawks also made an appearance. The day ended with a couple of harriers including some beautiful adult males and an Osprey. We also had some non-raptor highlights today. A Band-tail Pigeon hung out on the railing during our noon Hawk Talk and a lovely proposal happened with a gorgeous view of the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. Congratulations to the happy couple from the Saturday 1 Hawkwatch Team!<br/>

<p>While it was a somewhat overcast day, we were able to have a full day of Hawkwatch and see a nice variety of species. Some of our highlights were a sub-adult Bald Eagle, multiple Broad-winged Hawks, and quite a few Merlins. This year, we have begun a new side project in partnership with Golden Gate Cetacean Research. Although we only record data when we observe whales in and around the San Francisco Bay, today we got a great look at a Steller Sea Lion enjoying a fish while being mobbed by gulls. It was great to see such a large marine mammal swimming below the raptors at Hawk Hill! <br/>

<p>Unfortunately, the fog was thick in the headlands today and prevented Thursday 1 from getting any Hawkwatching in. Though there were brief glimpses at some Accipiters darting in and out of the fog, the clouds were unforgiving and we quickly lost visibility. However, the team was able to join one of our outreach education group for a raptor release, where we got to see a female Sharp-shinned Hawk get released and disappear into the fog. <br/>

<p>Broad-wings, broad-wings, broad-wings! The Wednesday 1 team continue the Broad-winged Hawk trend with highlights including a light-morph and dark-morph adult. Aside from the Broad-winged Hawks, the group got good looks at Red-shouldered Hawks, dark morph Red-tailed Hawks, male American Kestrels, and a few Northern Harriers, including a Grey Ghost. The day ended when the fog came and enveloped the hill, but was overall a sunny and exciting day. <br/>

<p>Our count started late today, but a kettle of hawks (including several Broad-winged Hawks!) greeted us as we got to the top of the Hill. At the time, with good winds and lifting fog, all seemed like a promising day for migration. Sadly, less than an hour later, our familiar companion, The Fog, returned to the Headlands and swallowed our chances of seeing any more birds. With visibility worsening by the minute, we officially suspended our count early, and are hoping for better Tuesday 1's (and other days) in the future. (A quick disclaimer  though we had a great 40 minutes counting hawks today, the short timing of our count means that our reported Raptors per Hour for the day is quite high)<br/>

<h2><a name='20180924'/>Monday, September 24, 2018</h2>
<p>The Monday I group enjoyed a morning of fog inversion (fog hanging low, sun on top of Hawk Hill) to start the fourth cycle of Hawkwatch! A bunch of Broad-winged Hawks, including a few late afternoon adults, were early visitors to Hawk Hill. The Broad-wings were often joined by Red-shouldered Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, and Northern Harriers, forming large kettles in front of the Golden Gate Bridge and Slacker Ridge. In addition to Buteos, the Hawkwatchers were frequently following falcons  American Kestrels, Merlins, and a mid-morning Peregrine to be exact. The migrating Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks continued to make appearances throughout the day (including an adult or two). Turkey Vultures and an Osprey capped the species count at 11. What started as a beautiful, sunny day ended at 3pm when the fog rolled back in.<br/>

<p>A very busy day at Hawk Hill today! Though we didn't have high hopes this morning looking at all of the fog, conditions improved throughout the day and we wound up recording our greatest number of raptors yet this season (with an average of over 115 raptors per hour!). In addition to the many Accipiters we saw in flight today we were fortunate to see many Broad-winged Hawks from the Hill, including some adults, as well as a good number of Merlins and our first Bald Eagle of the season! Hoping that the skies stay clear for future Hawkwatch teams. <br/>

<p>An uncooperative layer of fog prevented Saturday 2 from getting up the hill today, but the team still managed to get some great Hawkwatching done! During our hike around the lagoon and nearby trails, we saw 7 species of raptors. Osprey, Northern Harriers, American Kestrels, and Turkey Vultures all made appearances. We also saw Red-tails and Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks hunting in the fields. Hopefully the fog lifts soon and the team can get back to proper hawk counting next time!<br/>

<p>The first hour and 25 minutes of our day were beautiful; a strong northwest wind was blowing, the sun was shining, and Accipiters were flying left and right. Fog loomed over the ocean, but we continued counting raptors and watching Sharp-shinned Hawks dart about in the wind until it suddenly swept over the entire hill and left us with no visibility. We packed up our spotting scopes and binoculars and retreated down to Conzelman Road to attempt to wait out the fog, and yet it did not lift. Although we had to leave the hill early, we were able to get in one productive hour. Hopefully the gloomy weather will clear for tomorrow's team!<br/>

<p>Thursday 2 faced uncharacteristically warm temperatures up on Hawk Hill today, but it was worth it for all the great views of raptors we had. There were close ups of both adult and juvenile Ferruginous Hawks, plenty of Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks, and kettles of Turkey Vultures, Red-shouldered Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, and Broad-winged Hawks. At noon, we got a fantastic look at an adult Golden Eagle flying right below the hill! Despite the heat, Hawkwatch had a great full day on the hill. <br/>

<p>Wednesday 2 was a busy day for hawk counting! The morning started with a slew of sharpie sightings  which continued throughout the day  as well as our usual Red-tails, Turkey Vultures, Northern Harriers and many Osprey. The species count began to climb late in the morning as Red-shouldered Hawks, American Kestrels, Broad-winged Hawks, and Merlins appeared around Hawk Hill. Mid-afternoon, a adult Ferruginous Hawk appeared amongst a group of Red-tails before flying towards the Golden Gate Bridge. A late in the day Golden Eagle made a quick appearance before disappearing behind the hill, unseen thereafter. A wonderful, sunny 14-species day!<br/>

<p>Started out as a foggy day, but the morning was filled with sightings of sea lions being released, porpoises, whales and a look at a rare Eastern Yellow Wagtail. The fog started to lift and Tuesday 2 was finally able to make it up to Hawk Hill where we were able to see an adult Red-shouldered Hawk. While we weren't up for very long today, we have high hopes that we have reached our fog quota for the season and will be expecting many clear days ahead. <br/>

<p>The Monday II team was greeted by a wall of fog upon arrival in the Headlands. Not to be deterred, the group set out to bird along the Miwok and Bobcat Trails and was rewarded with looks at 2 sleepy Great-horned Owls, a female American Kestrel mid-hunt, and an adult Red-tailed Hawk, which was promptly harassed by a male American Kestrel. Before leaving, the Hawkwatch team encountered a crowd of enthusiastic birders by Rodeo Lagoon. These birders pointed out the exact location of an Eastern Yellow Wagtail, which appeared in the distance a few minutes after the team arrived.<br/><br/>E-bird report of Eastern Yellow Wagtail (by William Legge): https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S48573259<br/><br/>

<p>After getting fogged out the past two Sunday 1's, we broke the record for the season so far with over 500 raptors! Though at times it seemed as if the fog would win, we had mostly clear skies throughout the day and were able to spot Red-tailed Hawks, Red-shouldered Hawks, and lots of Accipiters. Our patience with the fog was rewarded with two late afternoon Ferruginous Hawks, with one coming especially close to the Hill. The day wrapped up with some adult Red-tails hunting directly over us, making us feel less like the Hawkwatchers and more like the Hawkwatch-ees! It was great to finally get up on the Hill with Sunday 1 for the best day yet of the season. <br/>

<p>Fog drifted in and out of the Headlands today, making for some frustratingly short views of raptors. The team was still able to get some good looks at Red-tailed, Sharp-shinned, and Cooper's Hawks, with some flying right over the hill in front of us. There was also a great sighting of a Merlin that flew low overhead before disappearing into the clouds. Later in the day, we had a clear view of some Broad-winged Hawks and an Osprey over the water. A Humpback Whale was also seen from the hill, and the team had fun watching it smack the water with its fluke before diving down and swimming away. <br/>

We saw more Sharp-shinned Hawks than Cooper's Hawks today. We also were delighted to see a couple Northern Harriers rise through the fog. As we left the hill, a juvenile Sharp-shinned flew low over all our heads and gave us a great look at it, almost as if it were saying goodbye. Until next time, sweet sharpies!<br/>

Other fun sightings included Broad-wingeds, Red-shouldereds, and a juvenile White-tailed Kite and a Ferruginous Hawk! We also were able to see a juvenile Peregrine Falcon hunting in the hills.

<p>Starting the third (sunny) cycle of Hawkwatch, Monday I team had an exciting 15-species day on Hawk Hill! The count began with many of our often-seen species like Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures. However, as the day continued, we began to see more diversity and greater numbers. Sharp-shinned Hawks and Cooper's Hawks rode along the Slacker ridgeline from noon onwards. A sub-adult Golden Eagle flew around Hawk Hill toward San Francisco, giving the team time to look at feather molt and determine the age of the bird. Northern Harriers flew in rocking dihedrals down in the valleys around the counting platforms. By the end of the day, the team had also welcomed three new species to this seasons' count: a distant dark morph Swainson's Hawk, a fast-moving Merlin, and a soaring adult Ferruginous Hawk. <br/>

<p>A beautiful day for Saturday 2, and the best for Hawkwatch in a while. The good weather brought out lots of hawks for us to see  in addition to the regular Red-tail Hawks and Cooper's Hawks, we got a look at a Northern Harrier, an Osprey, and three beautiful White-tailed Kites. We also were lucky enough to see a Red-shouldered Hawk at today's Raptor Release (which accompany the noon Hawk Talks every weekend in September and October!). We also got to witness the launching of System 001 with The Ocean Cleanup Project, passing under the bridge and past Hawk Hill on its way to start cleaning up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. All told, an enjoyable day in the sun (with a nice breeze at the end) for Saturday 2!<br/>

<p>Today was a brief but successful day for Friday 2! Before we ventured up to Hawk Hill we saw a pod of at least 10 bottlenose dolphins from Rodeo Beach, and spent some time watching non-raptorial birds at the lagoon.  Although we did not ever fully shake the fog, we had an hour on the hill with a lot of Red-tailed Hawk activity and even got a look at a White-tailed Kite before the fog blew back in and covered our views. Here's to hoping the fog will finally clear for our weekend teams! <br/>

<p>It was another foggy day, but we were able to watch a Sea Lion get released by the Marine Mammal Center on the beach near our office building! We then had a nice stroll around the lagoon. We saw Wilson's Warblers, American Goldfinches and some Anna's Hummingbirds. There were also a couple of juvenile Black-crowned Night-Herons and Great Blue Herons hanging out in a tree together, and the team had a fun time comparing and contrasting the two species. Despite not getting up to Hawk Hill, Thursday 2 still had a great time bird watching today!<br/>

<p>Wednesday 2 faced a formidable amount of fog this morning and was unable to make it up to Hawk Hill. However, the team still had a good time birding on the beach and around the lagoon, seeing Western Sandpipers, a Pectoral Sandpiper, Marbled Godwits, and Red-necked Phalaropes. We also saw some Wilson's Warblers, Pacific-slope Flycatchers, Rough-winged Swallows, and Golden-crowned Sparrows. The team also got a great look at a low flying tagged Turkey Vulture, #372! Overall, the team had a fun time hanging out and are hoping for clear skies for next Wednesday 2. <br/>

<h2><a name='20180904'/>Tuesday, September 04, 2018</h2>
<p>For our second outing in a row, Tuesday 2 was thwarted by an excess of fog above Hawk Hill. Despite this continued adversity, we birded around the Headlands in the hope that the fog would later lift (sadly, it did not). We did see a few Townsend's Warblers to brighten our day, however, and got some looks at intermediate- and dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks as well. Hoping the fog comes to an end soon, since we want to see more raptors - as well as our shadows. <br/>

<p>Foiled again by the fog! Though Sunday 1 did our best to remain optimistic for clearer skies, the thick fog did not retreat throughout the afternoon. Despite this, we were able to get a few glimpses of Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, American Kestrels, and a Cooper's Hawk flying in and out of the clouds. We remain hopeful for future fogless Sundays! <br/>

We also saw two Osprey fly over, as well as a juvenile Northern Harrier. It was the first day of noon Hawk Talks, and we got the chance to talk about raptor migration to some visitors to the Marin Headlands.

<p>Friday 1 had a great time watching warblers while waiting for the fog to clear; we had some great looks at Townsend's Warblers, Yellow Warblers, Common Yellowthroats, and even a Hermit Warbler, not to mention some other songbird species, as well. We finally made it up onto the hill, but the fog came back in and we had to call the day early. Before we called the day, we did get a great look at a male Kestrel and saw an adult male Northern Harrier to the Northeast before it disappeared into the fog.  <br/>

<p>Today was a beautiful day on Hawk Hill! However, the lack of wind made the entire morning very slow for hawk sightings. We did see two Osprey, including one juvenile, and got an exciting look at two Northern  Harriers crossing over the entrance to the bay, flying very close to the water. Two different tagged Turkey Vultures visited the hill multiple times today, so to future teams: bring your zoom lenses! The only falcons we saw were the pair of Peregrine Falcons perched on the North Tower, though as we were packing up at the end of the day we got a close look at a beautiful female American Kestrel flying overhead.  <br/><br/><br/>

<p>Today Tuesday 1 was fogged out, yet again. We spent some time birding by the Visitor's Center and saw a few birds, including a Townsend's Warbler, before we ventured up to the Annex. We did get to see a particularly beautiful Red-tailed Hawk show off its rufous breast while perched, and a Red-shouldered juvenile soared in front of us for enough time for us to get some practice following birds with scopes. Unfortunately, the fog did not clear, so we ended the day early. Hoping for better luck next time!<br/>

As the fog lifted, we caught a glimpse of the local Peregrines that hang out around the Golden Gate Bridge's north tower. Later on, we had a few American Kestrels zoom past us on the hill. All in all, it was a good day that wrapped up GGRO's first full cycle of the migration season. Here's to many more exciting days to come! <br/>

Eventually, the poor visibility made us cut the day short, but the team still had a great time hanging out on the hill. Here's to hoping for fog-less days on future Saturday 2s!<br/><br/>

<p>Friday 1 was another success story; what started off as a foggy morning turned into good conditions for hawkwatching. We got up onto Hawk Hill by noon and spent the afternoon counting. Being a small team with a lot of experience plus two apprentices and an intern, we spent a lot of time talking about field marks, flight style and shapes of the birds that passed us on the hill. We got a good look at a far away Peregrine Juvenile interacting with a Red-tailed juvenile, which made for great discussion and comparison. Thanks to some keen eyes we spotted two Kestrels in the last half hour of the day, as well as a tagged Turkey Vulture, whose number we were unable to read. We're all looking forward to reconvening on the hill, as a small but mighty team! <br/>

<p>Despite the hazy, overcast skies, Thursday 2 had a great time out on Hawk Hill today! We saw many Red-tails hunting over the hills, allowing us to get some practice aging them. We also caught glimpses of American Kestrels, Cooper's Hawks, and an Osprey throughout the day. There was much excitement mid-day when a group of Turkey Vultures flew right over the hill and we noticed one had a wing-tag. Everyone scrambled to get a good look at it, and together we were able to read its number - #368! Another highlight of the day was when an adult Peregrine Falcon zoomed around the hill, allowing everyone to get a nice long look at it. Overall, it was a wonderful first day and we are hopeful for more days like today. <br/>

<p>Today served as a great first day on the hill for our Wednesday 2 team! The hill was clear this morning, so we all hustled into our cars to start hawkwatching as quickly as we could. The fog came in and out intermittently in the morning with few birds in the sky, but as the day went on it stayed clear for us and we started seeing some cool birds. Multiple groups of Rough-winged Swallows and Band-tailed Pigeons flew by the hill, and we saw harbor porpoises and a humpback whale spouting in front of the bridge. We saw five raptor species in total, with one juvenile Cooper's Hawk that showed up in the last five minutes of the day making the only Accipiter of the day. We're all looking forward to reconvening on the hill in September.<br/>

Hopefully, next week will bring clearer weather and additional interesting birds to see!<br/>

<p>Sunday 1 had a slow start due to the considerable amount of fog over Hawk Hill. However, the group still had a good time birding around the nearby lagoon, seeing seabirds such as Brown Pelicans, Double-crested Cormorants, and Western Gulls. We also spotted some Blue-gray Gnatcatchers and a Cedar Waxwing in the nearby bushes! Later, we moved over to a mowed field and got some great views of foraging passerines such as House Finches, Western Bluebirds, White-crowned Sparrows, and Spotted Towhees. There was also a great moment where we saw an American Kestrel angrily dive at a Red-tailed Hawk that was hanging out in a tree. Despite the poor weather conditions that prevented us from getting up the hill, Sunday 1 still had a fun morning birding!<br/>

<p>Today marked the first day of Hawkwatch for Thursday 1. The morning started off well; minutes after we got settled in our quadrants an Osprey appeared straight overhead. We continued having a steady stream of sightings throughout the day, with a handful of juvenile Red-tailed Hawks every hour plus others. We even caught sight of a Turkey Vulture that was tagged for our Project Zopilote! The vulture appeared a few times right below us and even though the bright blue patagial tags are large with three printed numbers, we all struggled to get a good view of the number. However, passing the tagged vulture between quadrants was a great team-building experience for us and added some excitement to our pre-peak day!<br/><br/> We would definitely recommend other Hawkwatchers who have cameras with good zoom capability to bring them out, not only to take pictures of the beautiful migrants we see, but also to take pictures of tagged vultures. <br/><br/>

<p>Despite a foggy start to the week, today Hawkwatch kicked off the first official day of raptor counting for the 2018 fall migration season! We were lucky to have seen Peregrine Falcons, Northern Harrier and a small group of Purple Martins while on the Hill. Our team got a lot of practice identifying Red-tailed Hawks as many decided to hover overhead for long periods of time. An adult Accipiter flew overhead, helping to shake off the off-season rust of having to differentiate Cooper's Hawks from Sharp-shinned Hawks. In the end it was an adult Cooper's Hawk. A great first day on Hawk Hill, and an excited look to what the season will bring!<br/>

Conditions around the office seemed to be improving around 11:30, so we took an optimistic drive up to the Annex. Unfortunately, the fog near the Hill did not clear, and we were forced to call the day early. However, the uncooperative weather did not keep our team from getting some good looks at juvenile Cooper's Hawks, a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk, and even an Osprey!

<p>Greetings readers!<br/>Here at GGRO, we're eager to announce the start of Hawkwatch 2018! This season, Hawkwatch is thrilled to have so many wonderful volunteers returning and proud to be joined by 28 new apprentices. <br/>Unfortunately, the season started with a fogged-out day. However, the Monday 1 team managed to make the best of it by taking a Raptor ID quiz and watching flight videos. These educational moments were designed to help train new Hawkwatchers as well as to refresh raptor identification to everyone in the program. The team put their skills to the test, identifying a Red-tailed Hawk and Turkey Vultures down by the Lagoon later in the morning.<br/>Overall, it's exciting to have everyone back for the fall migration. Best of luck to the rest of the teams this week!<br/>
