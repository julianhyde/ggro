<p>Sunshine, beautiful array of distant clouds, blue skies... but wait, wasn't today supposed to rain? We thought so, but the 20-mph S gusts kept the storm at bay to the north of the Headlands.<br/><br/>Even with a late start, we managed to count the tail end of the migrating Turkey Vultures and Redtails. The highlight of the day, an adult Bald Eagle kiting the winds above North Slacker. Though it never got close, it flashed the low winter afternoon light and rushed north on the ridge, past FM Towers, where it did a tango with an adult Redtail and then continued back north.<br/><br/>With only fifteen minutes left in the count, an adult Cooper's Hawk moved skyward across Rodeo Valley. It pushed against the south wind and across the Golden Gate Bridge -the last migrant of the season.<br/><br/>We want to thank all of you that followed our journey this season.

<p>The hawkwatch team was greeted on Hawk Hill by a perfect adult female Peregrine kiting a slice through a 15 mph east wind this AM at 9 am.  Frozen in 3-dimensional apace. <br/><br/>With continued winds in the 40-50-degree range we layered up for the next five hours, and counted a good flight of Redtails, and a nice mix of accips, Kes, and Harrier in the 1's and 2's.<br/><br/>- Allen Fish<br/><br/>- Dayleaders: Horacio Mena, Holly Thomas<br/><br/>- Count Team: Mitch Green, Tomas McKay, Will Ludan, Allen Fish<br/><br/>

<p>The northern horizon was riddled with many layers of clouds that signaled the coming storm. The heavy clouds were accompanied by light 3-mph winds, and despite the chill in the air, we enjoyed the 50-60 degree-F weather as we counted the few birds passing by.<br/><br/>Even though the numbers hint at the final days of the season, the species diversity was something to be excited about. Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks lazily circled about, but Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks as well. A few Northern Harriers teetered along the contours of the Headlands, and the Peregrine Falcons that seem to have claimed Hawk Hill as their own, patrolled the skies. The most exciting species of the day arrived during the last hour. A juvenile Golden Eagle rose from behind a grove of trees to the north and slowly made its way over Slacker Ridge, gaining altitude before heading south. Within five minutes of that sighting, an adult Bald Eagle appeared over the Pacific Ocean, lined up with Rodeo Lagoon. It flew across the reflection of the descending Sun on the water before blending into the background of Golden Gate Park.<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Don Bartling<br/><br/>Count Team: Stefanie Arthur, Conner Cimmiyotti, John Davis, Sue Morgan, Laura Echávez<br/>

<p><br/>So here's a fun mental exercise:  Imagine in the morning in the Marin Headlands, breezes are warmish and from the East.  A fog bank sits a dozen miles off the Marin Coast, enveloping the Farallones.  There's some haze in the North and in the East bay.  At mid-day, there is an hour of warm doldrums until tiny wisps of light West winds start to tickle Hawk Hill. By 130 pm, the westerlies are a steady 5 mph, and the Pacific marine layer (aka fog) has made it to Rodeo Beach.  In the next hour, fog fingers into the Golden Gate and overtakes the outer Sunset, and by 245 pm, fog blots out the West and North vistas. At a few minutes to 3 pm (quitting time for a regular hawkwatch day), all views from Hawk Hill are snuffed out by the fog.<br/><br/>What time of year is this?  Of course, it is perfect late August weather at the Golden Gate. Perhaps September. But today? November 27, 2022.? An August day slipped into late November? Go figure.<br/><br/>We had a thin raptor day on Hawk Hill today - not abnormal for the last week of the fall migration. Were it not for one juvenile harrier, the day would have been a solid run of the Big Four species: Redtail, Coop, Sharpshin, and TV.  Thanks to Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures we averaged one sighting every two mins.  Enjoy the fog.

<p>Blazing southwest sun! No, we aren't talking about the desert, but rather this odd weather for a day in late November. High 60's and intermittent breezes up to 7 mph from the east made for a warm day with very few birds. Everyone who knows this Saturday 1 Team knows we love our Peregrine Falcons! Unfortunately, our falcon friend didn't stick around for the official count, but she did make her presence known early on from the parking lot viewpoint. If we needed any convincing on whether or not the migration was coming to an end for the winter, the migratory flow (lack thereof) confirmed it. Let's hope for a breezy day tomorrow to bring in the last birds of the season. <br/> <br/>-Carmen DeLeon, CCS Program Coordinator <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Mary Malec & Brian O'Laughlin <br/><br/>Count Team: Jeff Boissier, Rasia Holzman Smith, Melissa Hero, Alexandra Cox, Allen Fish, Carmen DeLeon <br/><br/> <br/>

<p>The weather was pleasant, though we will still throw in a slight complaint about the wind direction steady from the east and then switching south around 3-7 mph. Partly cloudy skies brought plenty of sunshine with smudgy clouds and a bit of haze to the south. Temperatures were in the mid 60's getting quite warm midday to 68 degrees F.  <br/><br/>Every day is a good day when you see a Sharp-shinned Hawk. A close flyby of a Sharpie in the west headed just a wingtip away from our counter in the quadrant gave us all flashbacks to mid-October accipiters. Migration seemed to trickle along today with Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks. A Cooper's Hawk gave us an afternoon close-up that raised our spirits till we concluded and wished the Friday 1 Team well until the next season.  <br/><br/>-Carmen DeLeon, Conservation and Community Science Program Coordinator <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Holly Thomas & Libby Rouan <br/><br/>Count Team:  Horacio Mena, Yvette MacDonald, Allen Fish, Carmen DeLeon <br/>

<p>Though a far cry from a peak day of bird sightings, we suspect that we may have a peak in wind conditions with constant NE wind 25-30 mph and gusting upwards of 34 mph! Clear, sunny skies at 60 degrees F kept us able to gather some radiant heat. The usual suspects of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures were in flight with a few other birds braving the wind. We had a nice look at an adult Red-shouldered Hawk rising above Rodeo Valley before gliding off toward Hill 88. An adult Peregrine Falcon was the only bird unphased by the windy conditions, gracefully slicing through the sky and overhead.  <br/><br/>We concluded today's Hawkwatch early at 1 PM to set aside time for our team to choose and reflect on their own versions of Thanksgiving. We recognize that today is not a celebration for all and we hold space for those coming together in resilience, healing, resistance, and community. As a Hawkwatch team, we come with our own stories, yet are unified in gratitude for the opportunity to spend time in nature monitoring the migration made possible by the life-sustaining Earth. <br/><br/>-Carmen DeLeon, CCS Program Coordinator<br/><br/>Dayleader:Christine Cariño<br/><br/>Count Team: John Davis, Susan Greef, Gretchen Zantzinger Carmen DeLeon   <br/>

<p>Modest winds from the east, hardly detectable at times, kept temperatures around mid 60 degrees on Hawk Hill today. There was a shift during the last hour or so, where the winds became more noticeable and from the west, but the raptor activity stayed consistent with sightings being few and far between...  <br/><br/>A pair of Northern Harriers were observed flying over the north ridge in tandem with one another, hovering Red-tailed Hawks stooped on unsuspecting prey beneath the coyote brush, a Merlin was spotted in forceful and steady flight out beyond the south platform...  <br/><br/>Some of the count team caught a glimpse of a bobcat before it swiftly moved along and crossed the trail leading up to Hawk Hill. Just below the spot where the bobcat passed through, a visitor rested on the side of the trail and played a wooden flute for quite some time.

<p>Light NE winds and a wispy-cloud sky greeted us on Hawk Hill this morning. Temps started about 60-deg and peaked with no-wind around noon at 70, then fell off as the afternoon NW winds rallied.  Raptors were steady but distant fliers today with a few dozen accipiters spread through the day and nearly a dozen harrier sightings.  <br/><br/>Redtails and TV's accounted for most of the sightings, and a female adult Peregrine continued to be active near the hilltop, even perching on the western railing for ten-plus mins as we were setting up this AM.<br/><br/>With holiday vacations starting up, we had a small but steady arrival of friendly and curious people at the fence-line: <br/><br/>	A family from Atlanta, GA, thrilled to see an Atlanta (Peregrine) Falcon in the sky over Hawk Hill<br/><br/>	A couple from Durango, CO, doing research for a book on National Parks<br/><br/>	Scott and his daughter Sharon from Sausalito, CA<br/><br/>	6 -year old Bobby practicing counting the rarest hawk species numbers on our count-board, and his mom from Austin, TX<br/><br/>	Two young adult brothers, together for the holiday, one stationed at Travis Air Force Base near Vacaville, CA, and the other from Orlando, FL, who described for me the damage to the Jurassic Park exhibit from the hurricanes and flooding this past fall<br/><br/>	Michele from Brentwood, CA, part-way through a two-year plan to hike all the trails in the Marin Headlands, and a great lover of wildlife<br/><br/>	Joe, a mechanical engineer with the US Army from Yuma, AZ, and his young son Wyatt, who explained to me that an Osprey was a Fish Hawk, and gave me several other useful raptor pointers<br/><br/>	Alexi, a pharmacy student from Toronto, raised in Brittany, France, who was heading to San Diego for a few days before flying back to the Northeast.

Some are, but most are not.  Most are wide-eyed travelers, some close to home, some far, who are just discovering Hawk Hill and are captivated by its vistas, by its historical structures, by its changing angles of light, by its fog and fog horns, its bunnies and ravens, its coyote brush and grasslands, and even, its birds of prey.<br/><br/>-	Allen Fish<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Andy Bradshaw, Mary Kenney<br/><br/>Count Team: Woody Woodbury, Chris Tarr, Rich Eliason, Allen Fish<br/><br/>

<p>East winds were persistent and gusted around 20 mph throughout the day up on Hawk Hill, and we observed 9 species at a rate of 34.8 hawks per hour. Red-tailed Hawks were tucked in tight glides, unsteady Sharp-shinned Hawks zipped overhead, and Northern Harriers teetered and gained lift easily in the howling wind. A male American Kestrel flickered and powered through the gusts, zipped directly overhead, and disappeared out beyond the Golden Gate Bridge.  <br/><br/>On Hawk Hill, there are many compelling moments that claim your attention and often pull at your heartstrings.

A few mid-fielders came out: a stunning adult Redshoulder, two American Kestrels, and a fair flight of Northern Harriers including an adult female in the afternoon.  <br/><br/>The best showing was a subadult Bald around 11 am that stayed about 200 feet up and made a ten-minute glide into San Francisco.

<p>A blustery day of strong winds from the east and northeast nearly sent some of our Hawkwatchers kiting like Red-tailed Hawks as they pushed against the gusts to stand steady in their quadrants. A consistent 15-19 mph wind made for challenging flight conditions. The sky was clear and blue with only a light haze and temperatures around 55 degrees F.  <br/><br/>Peregrine Falcons sliced through the fierce wind with ease and a few Sharp-shinned Hawks were whooshed overhead. The highlight of our day was a smaller bird spotted down low in the Rifle Range. At first, we wondered if it was an accipiter hunting the scrubland. As the bird rose, we noticed the strong contrast pattern of black bars on the tail and a stubby buteo silhouette. It was a late-season adult Broad-winged Hawk! The Broadwing took its time circling alone higher and higher above Hawk Hill before gliding into the blue. The weather conditions made today a tough one to stick out, and we are sure glad we did!  <br/><br/>-Krista Fanucchi, GGRO Biotech & Carmen DeLeon, CCS Program Coordinator<br/><br/>Dayleader: Jane Rudebusch <br/><br/>Count Team: Mary Malec, Lora Roame, Michael Voeltz, Maryrose Kulick, Krista Fanucchi, Carmen DeLeon <br/>

<p>Just a whisper of wind and cloudless skies with sunshine all around kept the day warm and still with temperatures at 58-63 degrees F and scattered westerly gusts of up to 6 mph. A light haze dusted the cityscape and wrapped across the Farallones.  <br/><br/>Without a consistent wind, birds were slowly rising up from the valley in varying directions before circling above the hillside or disappearing back north. A quick glance at Ferruginous Hawks got our hopes up for more buteo sightings. We eagerly awaited the possibility of interesting Red-tailed Hawk plumages as we often see a second peak of Redtails into mid-November. A Redtail with a light belly almost empty of brown speckling made us wonder if it was a migrant from the intermountain west. To round out the day, a smattering of Sharp-shinned Hawks made their way through the valley as they rose overhead to cross the bay and Merlins tore through the air high and low.  <br/> <br/>Dayleaders: Holly Thomas & Horacio Mena <br/><br/>Count Team: Will Ludan, Tomas McKay, Paulette Sherry, Mitchell Green, Carmen DeLeon <br/>

As the wind stopped between each directional shift, then started again, we had small groups of birds swirl through with the gusts. Temperatures ranged from 55-62 degrees F. <br/><br/>Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures glided in from all directions before floating out across the bay. It was quite a treat to still see scattered Sharp-shinned Hawks twinkle up from Rodeo Valley. As we spotted one with a full crop, we wished it well along its migration and wondered what migratory songbird it had preyed upon. <br/> <br/>Our excitement of the day was a chance to compare Northern Harrier plumages. The pumpkin glow of juvenile harriers was the most common age class sighted. A grey ghost- the adult male- swiftly rose from behind Hawk Hill to fly fast toward the ocean as it rose to the clouds. Not far behind was an adult female blazing across the rolling hillsides. It looks like our November migrators are ready to go and we can't wait to see who flies through next time! <br/><br/>-Carmen DeLeon, Conservation & Community Science Program Coordinator<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Christine Cariño & Gretchen Zantzinger <br/><br/>Count Team: Bob Blumberg, Patricia Contaxis, Holly Thomas, Carmen DeLeon <br/><br/> <br/>

<p>Clear skies all around today, with a gradual haze line developing over the East Bay.  Temps from 60-70 deg, and winds blew gusty in the morning, went dead as doldrums by mid-day, then re-emerged around 1 pm from the NW.  Best flights happen with some kinda wind in the air - almost doesnt matter what direction.  I said almost.<br/><br/>Great close looks today at accips, also some close Merlins and Kestrels and Harriers.  Redtails are still streaming, and it's starting to feel like a normal "late peak" of Redtails (Redtails at the Marin Headlands nearly always show a late September peak, a dip in October, and then a mid November peak bigger than Sept.)<br/><br/>An adult Bald Eagle made a sudden and hard-flapping southbound flight east of Slacker Ridge before 11 am.  Two WT Kites showed off at the day's end.

<p>Zero clouds and light winds made for an excellent late season flight today.  Cool winds varied from nil to 10 mph from the NE, mid-50s to mid-60s in temps, and the flight occurred both far and overhead.  Bright bright skies made for high contrast birds that were easy to tell to species but challenging to age, esp in the south where glare reigns supreme after high noon.<br/><br/>Some great looks at juv harriers today, also a good number of Sharps and many Redtails. The raptor highlight of the day was most likely the one or two adult Bald Eagles that appeared between 1:30 and 2:30 pm along the Wolf Ridgeline and as far east as Wolfback Ridge. Why one or two? Neither adult carried individual field-marks that one might look for on an adult Bald, for example missing/molty flight feathers, or brown-tipping on the tail or brown smudging around the eyes and auriculars.  In other words, they both looked like adult Bald Eagles in excellent plumage.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest challenge of the Marin Headlands hawk count -- given the propensity of birds to move in many directions not North to South, and given the undulating terrain -- is to know which birds have been counted previously.  If you have spent more than an hour on Hawk Hill, you will know this: a raptor cannot be reliably tracked from far North to far South on a clean line.  So today we had two adult Bald Eagle sightings, spaced more than a half hour apart, at different altitudes, and the guiding question we use to decide whether to count a bird is this - can you be 95% sure this is the same bird you counted before?  If no, the bird is counted.  If yes, the bird is not counted.  <br/><br/>So the data today will reflect 2 Bald Eagle sightings. Interestingly, those weren't the most startling birds of the day - that would have to be the lone Tundra Swan that appeared in the south flying 500 feet above the Golden Gate heading toward Sausalito.  We enjoyed a dorsal view of this spectacularly large white bird as it cruised over the tourists at Battery Spencer and disappeared east of 101.  <br/><br/>Cherish the unexpected.<br/><br/>-	Allen Fish<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Catherine Elliott, Mary Kenney<br/><br/>Count Team: Dennis Davison, Maureen Grabowski, Woody Woodbury, Holly Thomas, Allen Fish<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p>There was a mix of good company on chilly Hawk Hill today, hawkwatchers and hawks alike... Winds were mild and shifted frequently, but were predominantly coming from the NE. The count team observed 11 species at a rate of 42.8 hawks per hour, many of those sightings being close views of strikingly beautiful birds.  <br/><br/>Some of those close individuals included a White-tailed Kite, an adult Ferruginous Hawk, a few Northern Harriers, and a Merlin that zipped fast overhead. We also had the good fortune of spotting a distant adult Bald Eagle just east of Mount Tam, before it stealthily flew beyond a ridge and remained out of sight. Looking forward to the company of more birds and bird-observers to come.

<p>It was a beautiful, unclouded blue sky day up on Hawk Hill. West winds were variable and at times it was completely calm with temperatures hovering around 64-degrees F. The count team observed 9 species at a rate of 24.8 hawks per hour, including a distant Ferruginous Hawk spotted near Mount Tam.  <br/><br/>A very impressive, non-raptor sighting appeared in the form of a flock of around 150 Band-tailed Pigeons as they swirled around in a "murmuration" like formation above the Slacker ridge. They flew in this continuous loop, doughnut, or whirl for over 2 minutes, and the vortex fully absorbed our attention and delight. It is just so easy to get caught up, twisted, and spellbound by these fleeting moments...  <br/><br/>-Krista Fanucchi, GGRO Assistant Biotechnician <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Dennis Davison, Allen Fish <br/><br/>Count Team: Laura Coatney, Melissa Kohner, Rod Santos, Holly Thomas, Krista Fanucchi <br/>

<p>A crystal clear day with a perfectly crisp autumn breeze set the stage for today's Hawkwatch. Wispy clouds and bright blue were the backdrop for most of the birds as the variable wind had birds coming high overhead and far along the neighboring ridgelines. Temperatures warmed up as the sun kept shining landing us around 65 degrees F. <br/> <br/>The morning belonged to the tiny falcons. We were soaking in the sighting as a very relaxed Merlin as it was gliding across the sky without even flapping. American Kestrels zipped and hovered into the hillsides. With the bold presence of these smaller birds, we supposed that big falcons were still far away. <br/> <br/>A bout of excitement came with an unexpected assist from a Red-tailed Hawk. We spotted the Redtail stilling high above the Rifle Range and drifting back and forth. It suddenly tucked its wings tight and dove straight down, down, down. That is until it collided with two other birds. As the tangle of talons and feathers rolled low above the scrubland, we put together the pieces of the puzzle to see that a pair of Redtails had chased a Short-eared Owl up out of its roost. The lofty owl floated up in a moth-like fashion, circling higher in the valley until it headed away toward Mount Tam.  <br/><br/>The Saturday 1 Team sends a special thank you to our guest counter for the day! 2018 GGRO intern, Kirsti, recently returned from a season at the Goshute Mountains HawkWatch and was kind to lend us extra help on the hill today. <br/><br/>-Carmen DeLeon, Conservation & Community Science Program Coordinator<br/> <br/>Dayleaders: Mary Malec & Brian O'Laughlin <br/> <br/>Count Team: Jeff Boissier, Rasia Holzman Smith, Melissa Hero, Alexandra Cox, Carmen DeLeon <br/><br/>Guest Counter: Kirsti Carr <br/>

<p>The late autumn sky was fully displayed with glowing sunshine washing across the contour of the hills and bay. Just a thin haze was making its way around the clear visibility out to Mt. Diablo and the Farallones. Blue skies were dotted, dashed, and swooshed with clouds that framed small pockets of rainbows high above. There were variable whispers of wind with temperatures around 57 degrees F. <br/><br/>We continued to see the slow of birds with the season tapering off, finding enjoyment in spending quality time with each sighting. Without a steady wind, birds were spotted 5th quadrant high, far along the ridgelines, and popping up low along the valley. Groups of Turkey Vultures wobbled across Mount Tam and Red-tailed Hawks rose over the bay. A highlight of our day was a close look at an adult female Northern Harrier gliding along Hawk Hill. From above, we appreciated the variation in brown feathers showing retained and new. <br/><br/>One of our final sightings was a Sharp-shinned Hawk spotted as a mere speck at the Mt. Tam ridgeline. We followed it until it was directly overhead and was joined by a Cooper's Hawk. Both accipiters swirled toward the sun with only their dark silhouettes visible as if to put a stamp of approval on a lovely day of late-season Hawkwatch. <br/><br/>-Carmen DeLeon, Conservation and Community Science Program Coordinator <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Libby Rouan and Holly Thomas <br/><br/>Count Team: Laura Thomas, Conner Cimmiyotti, Horacio Mena, Yvette MacDonald, Carmen DeLeon <br/><br/>

<p>Stellar visibility atop Hawk Hill today! The day started at a crispy 53-degrees F with gusty 9-mph winds from the south. The cold air came from all directions throughout the day, but we closed with a gentle 5-mph wind from the SW and at 58-degrees F.<br/><br/>This is the time of the season where we expect to see a peak in Northern Harrier sightings, and though they have been scarce this year, we did observe 6! Usually picked up in the valley, today's Harriers were caught as they rushed across the Bay. Fortunately, we are also still seeing accipiters trickling through -though no adults were amongst that handful. When we were setting up for the count, we lamented about a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk that did not stick around until the official start. However, at around 11AM, another juvenile was seen flap-flap-gliding across Rodeo Valley.<br/><br/>As we get later in the season, the days are getting shorter and slower. However, there is always a chance for something exciting... like the trusty pair of Peregrine Falcons incessantly patrolling the grounds. Are these the new residents?

<p>Every day on Hawk Hill is uniquely beautiful, dynamic, and fascinating. The brilliance of the autumn light, a warm flash of orange from a juvenile Northern Harrier, the iridescent feathers of a Common Raven...!  <br/><br/>There was a steady west wind, and the count team observed a total of 8 species at a rate of 27.8 hawks per hour. Red-tailed Hawks were seen kiting and lifting way overhead on an invisible elevator before being stooped on and chased off by the pair of Peregrine Falcons. An adult Bald Eagle was spotted near the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge, soaring steadily as it flew against the east bay and drifted off in a northern direction; an adult Red-tailed Hawk and Turkey Vulture were trailing close behind in good company.

<p>As soon as the count team arrived to Hawk Hill for the day, bets were placed on when the downpour of rain would begin; what can we say, we cannot resist a friendly competition! The autumn light shifted and illuminated pockets of the Marin Headlands, and we experienced a mild sprinkling of rain around noon. The weather was dynamic and the conditions shifted quickly, so we continued counting until around 1:30pm.  <br/><br/>The series of loud, harsh, "kak-kak-kak-kak..." calls from two adult Peregrine Falcons were frequently heard from Hawk Hill as the pair have been spotted many times chasing Red-tailed Hawks in wide circles above Slacker ridge.

<p>We managed a day without fog between storms! It was a calm morning with a gentle wind from the NE that varied throughout the day, only reaching 8-mph gusts by the end of the day. Though clouds began to creep in after noon, for the most part, the temps lingered in the mid to upper 50's F.<br/><br/>Once again a pair of adult Peregrine Falcons welcomed our team at the top of Hawk Hill this morning. Many wispy cirrus clouds served as a backdrop as the Peregrines cut through the air, patrolling the area, and dutifully escorted any intruding Red-tailed Hawks out of the area. Luckily, a handful of adult and juvenile Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks avoided confrontations with the vociferous falcons. Another individual that dodged a pointed encounter was an adult Bald Eagle -probably because it was so far away, just below the peak of Tamalpais.<br/><br/>Our day ended just as it began, with a Peregrine tormenting anything in sight.

<p>Friday was a strange hawk-count day in the Marin Headlands. The wind -- around 2-5 mph -- squirreled from the SW to the NW to the S, all of which is typical for a pre-storm day.  Or maybe this was an actual storm day. Twice in the mid-day there were actual drops of rain patting the data tablet, and a rainbow was visible in the northern landscape from 1030 am til at least 1 pm.  Temps ranged from 58 to 65.<br/><br/>The migration rate was 19 raptor-sightings per hour with about a 45% Vulture Index. High points for the day were: a circling adult Peregrine doing surveillance on the western hill for a good 20 mins; and two handfuls of Sharpshins like up-falling leaves, circling upward zooming past Hawk Hill, alulas expanded and coasting on the wind.<br/><br/>- Allen Fish<br/><br/>Dayleader: Holly Thomas<br/><br/>Count Team: Tomas McKay, Paulette Sherry, Will Ludan, Mitchell Green, Allen Fish<br/><br/>

<p>Thursday, November 3rd was another spectacularly beautiful day from Hawk Hill. A cold, but gentle wind tip-toed from the south and circled the hill throughout the day as the temps lingered in the mid- to upper-50s. As the team walked up to the count site, a mother Humpback Whale and its calf meandered near the mouth of the Golden Gate, spouting and breaking the glassy surface of the San Francisco Bay.<br/><br/>The morning consisted of the usual migrants, mainly Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures, though we had a sprinkle of Cooper's Hawks as well. After lunch time, more species began to make an appearance. Sharp-shinned Hawks, Northern Harriers, and Peregrine Falcons were all in the mix -even a White-tailed Kite that seemed to be flying over the Earth's stratosphere. Around 2pm, a couple of Buteos circled over Slacker Ridge, one was a Redtail and the other a mysterious dark morph. As the dark morph bird broke off, it banked south and straight for San Francisco. Optics flew to the hawkwatchers' eyes, and we realized it was not another Redtail, instead... the eagerly awaited Rough-legged Hawk! At the end of the day, a juvenile Swainson's Hawk flew east over Mount Tamalpais, capping off an amazing day for the team.<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Allen Fish & Laura Echávez<br/><br/>Count Team: Pat Contaxis, Michaela Figari, Jim Yampolsky, Pauline Yeckley<br/>

<p>After yesterday's rain, there was a crispness in the air today. Our hawkwatchers were back on Hawk Hill, despite a brief 15-min rain at 11am. The magnificent storm clouds passed and made way for blue skies and a variety of clouds (cumulus, nimbus, and many wispies).<br/><br/>The bird front was very quiet, but the storm brought us two Bald Eagles! The first arrived straight out of the north, slowly soaring as it made its way right over the team.

<p>Hawk Hill was wrapped in fog this morning, but the conditions shifted, and the hawkwatch team was able to begin officially counting around 11. The fog lingered for most of the day, creeping closer and closer at times, but we maintained enough visibility to continue counting. The sun did peak out from the fog for the last couple of hours and the fall lighting illuminated the birds flying against Slacker ridge in a beautiful, glowing way. One of those birds was a juvenile Northern Harrier, and the rusty or "pumpkin" color seemed to radiate as the bird quickly passed through and continued its journey south.  <br/><br/>The hawkwatch team was a bit slim today, a "skeleton" crew as one hawkwatcher put it, and most agreed that the highlight of the day was a slow moving and steady Bald Eagle. It was a bit challenging to distinguish between juvenile and sub-adult plumage in the hazy mist and unfavorable light conditions, but we genuinely enjoyed the sighting, nonetheless...  <br/><br/>-Krista Fanucchi, GGRO Assistant Biotechnician <br/><br/>Dayleader: Allen Fish <br/><br/>Count Team: Roy Pisetsky, Linda Schneider, Jan Ambrosini, Tim Stroshane, Krista Fanucchi <br/>

<p>We were standing right on the edge of the fog, fading in and out of the mist, for a couple hours of hawk counting this afternoon. There were times when the veil was lifted and views of Slacker ridge, Angel Island, and the Golden Gate appeared quite clear; though the visibility did not remain. We did manage to get a couple hours of hawk counting in before being immersed in the fog, and enjoyed some good looks at an American Kestrel, a few Sharp-shinned Hawks, and quite a few Red-tailed Hawks.

<p>Through the light haze, an adult Peregrine Falcon speedily escorted the hawkwatch team as we hiked up to the top of Hawk Hill. A second Peregrine joined but neither stayed long enough to be included in the official count.<br/><br/>It was a comfortable 60F - 65F throughout the day, and the wind danced in and out, shifting from the SE to the NW by then end. Although it was beautiful out there, with strips of clouds perfect for using as skymarks, the migration appeared to have slowed down significantly. However, we did see many Red-tailed Hawks, 64 of them -which felt very "Redtail-y" compared to yesterday!

<p>We had a layer cake of a sky today with light haze low, partly cloudy above, and clear blue skies in the middle. Visibility was out to Mount Diablo and the Farallon Islands for most of the time. The wind was slow to start and variable, eventually gusting southwest up to 13 mph. Temperatures stayed at just about 60 degrees F ending with very chilly conditions for the North and West. <br/><br/>The day was slow to start with a handful of Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks far along the ridgelines and hugging the hillside down to Kirby Cove. We eagerly awaited the wind as we admired a full circle fog bow glowing around the sun-soaked clouds. Peregrine Falcons effortlessly zoomed through the increasing winds as a puff of fog moved in from the ocean. One was diving on a Red-tailed Hawk and the other circled higher alongside a Cooper's Hawk. We wondered if it was being considered competition or prey.  <br/><br/>As a few scattered Cooper's Hawks and Sharp-shinned Hawks zipped through the Headlands, we hoped that the day would end with a surprise. Indeed it did! Our team in North Quadrant noticed an interesting buteo flapping in from the ridge with distinctly pointed wingtips. An adult Swainson's Hawk navigated the swaths of clouds and blue as we watched it fly off toward the Bay Bridge. With a theatrical bookend to the day's adventure, our team recounted our appreciation for each other and the birds that bring us together as the skyline glowed a brilliant orange before extinguishing the light with a frigid burst of fog to wrap up the count. <br/> <br/>-Carmen DeLeon, Conservation and Community Science Program Coordinator <br/><br/>Dayleader: Holly Thomas <br/><br/>Count Team: Laura Thomas, Sonja Raub, Conner Cimmiyotti, Yvette MacDonald, Allen Fish, Carmen DeLeon <br/>

<p>Sunshine and blue skies continue to welcome us atop Hawk Hill! A cool 5-mph breeze graced the hillside, enough to provide birds with a little lift, but still keeping them at a comfortable just above eye-level flight!<br/><br/>As we approached the count site, a familiar face sat along the south platform lookout and carefully eyed our approach. An adult Peregrine Falcon that has been a frequent visitor for a couple of weeks now! It lazily circled over the area, close enough to project its shadow on the diligent hawkwatchers. Around lunch time, a raptor that we don't often see during migration emerged and nimbly crossed the Mt. Tamalpais ridgeline -a White-tailed Kite. Barely an hour later, another special raptor was picked up by our guest counter, Raptor Biologist & Banding Manager, Teresa Ely! A subadult Golden Eagle made a full tour around the Headlands and almost all the way across to downtown San Francisco. One Golden Gate crossing was not enough, however, as it turned around and headed back to the Headlands.<br/><br/>With just a little over a month left in the season, we could not ask for a better assortment of raptors for the Thursday hawkwatch team!<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech & Carmen DeLeon, CCS Program Coordinator<br/><br/>Dayleader: Christine Cariño<br/><br/>Count Team: Pat Bacchetti, Arden Bucklin-Sporer, Susan Greef, Teresa Ely, Carmen DeLeon, Laura Echávez<br/>

<p>Hawk Hill was filled with many visitors today; most of them being humans, of course! We enjoyed seeing two different school groups observing birds and wildlife and nature journaling along the way. Great work, young naturalists, we hope to see you up here as volunteers one day!  <br/><br/>The wind was a bit erratic today, blowing from the SE then NW then back again. Birds were far beyond Mount Tam, low above the rifle range, high overhead, and beyond the Golden Gate. Today was a great day to practice some scope spotting skills, as many of the avian visitors were distant specks along the furthest ridge lines. It was nice to see a few more Northern Harriers today as well... <br/><br/>Looking forward to seeing more birds and birdwatchers on the hill soon... <br/><br/>-Krista Fanucchi, Assistant Biotechnician <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Don Bartling, Jon Altemus <br/><br/>Count team: Linda Sudduth, John Davis, Sue Morgan, Jan Ambrosini, Krista Fanuchi <br/>

First winds were SW but flipped to west and NW with 15 mph gusting by the end of the day.  <br/><br/>A nice range of species flew by the hawkwatch today, including a fast-flapping Prairie Falcon and a slow-flapping White-tailed Kite.

<p>The hawkwatch team was showered with sunshine, but not so much with raptors; though we did appreciate the sightings and good company. Blue skies, few clouds, very light west winds, and birds drifting far and high overhead.  <br/><br/>The winds slightly increased around 1, and the Turkey Vultures soared, teetered, and continued to stack up in the direction of Mount Tam and Slacker ridge. The count team noticed an interesting looking dark morph Red-tailed Hawk as it lifted above the south platform with its wings raised in a conspicuous dihedral and displayed an admirable Turkey Vulture impression.

<p>Today was the perfect day atop Hawk Hill. It was a brisk 58-degree morning with gentle 6-mph winds and azure-blue skies above -some would say ideal hot chocolate weather. The only missing component for a late-October day: raptors.<br/><br/>The first couple of hours were exciting, with handfuls of distant and high overhead Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and some Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks. At one point, a speck of a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk soared over the Upper Rodeo Trail, slowly spiraling towards Sausalito. As we watched this Redshoulder, another team member noticed another Redshoulder below it, an adult this time. Before we knew it, there were four of them in our field of view at once!<br/><br/>At noon, there was a noticeable decline in activity. The only highlight for the afternoon came at 12:30pm, when a lanky buteo appeared above the Marin Mammal Center. As it flashed its dark flight feathers, a definitive fieldmark for this Western species, we quickly identified it as a Swainson's Hawk. We had a five-buteo day last week, and with these later Swainies and even Broad-winged Hawks, the chances of a six-buteo day in the coming weeks are looking pretty good!<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleader: Becky Olsen & Ken Wilson<br/><br/>Count Team: Paul Meadow, Kinley Renger, Carol Weinstein, Allen Fish, Laura Echávez<br/>

<p>Hello October sunshine! We were dazzled with the clear visibility out to Mt. Diablo as we welcomed the start of a peaceful autumn day. A light haze floated atop the ocean and out toward Pacifica. The blue skyline was dappled in fluffy white clouds which were the perfect contrasting backdrop for spotting birds. Wind was highly variable in direction and barely noticeable at times with a steadier 3-5 mph breeze taking us into the early afternoon. Though we got some close looks, many raptors seemed to be taking the 5th quadrant (overhead) approach to crossing the hillside while others stayed far out on the ridgeline of Slacker Hill.  <br/><br/>The first bird of the day did not disappoint! Our teammates of South and West Quadrants kicked it off with a large dark bird that was initially picked up as a Turkey Vulture. As they noticed the steady flight and distinct bold contrast, they cheerily announced that it was actually an adult Bald Eagle making its way across the valley. Our whole team gazed into the blue sky getting excellent looks as it soared by. With our eyes primed for the eagle silhouette, we also sighted a juvenile Bald Eagle later on. <br/><br/>Soon, the theme of the day became fast flapping falcons. Two adult Peregrine Falcons swooped in tight formation at a juvenile Peregrine in Kirby Cove letting it know that it had wandered too close. It was a morning filled with Peregrine acrobatics and the distinctive "kek kek kek" filled the air. We admired the dusty blue and rufous plumage of a male American Kestrel and noticed Merlins buzzing through the hillside. Several teammates followed a Merlin through the fifth quadrant and toward the span of the bridge as it faded into the distance over the East Bay.  <br/><br/>Overall, we were delighted with the wide open skies all day long and hope the conditions continue as we see what the migration brings tomorrow.<br/> <br/>Carmen DeLeon, Conservation & Community Science Program Coordinator & Krista Fanucchi, GGRO Biotech <br/> <br/>Dayleader: Jane Rudebusch <br/><br/>Count Team: Lora Roame, Michael Voeltz, Maryrose Kulick, Jennifer Miller, Mary Malec, Allen Fish, Krista Fanucchi, Carmen DeLeon <br/>

<p>Cold gray skies greeted the hawk count team this morning. So we quickly abandoned Hawk Hill for Rodeo Valley, and joined up with 15+ people seeking a glimpse of the Willow Warbler that is starting day 4 of offering very cooperative looks for birders.  After a few glimpses of the warbler, and good looks at a Tropical Kingbird, we called it quits for the 1 pm fog-caused shutdown.<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Holly Thomas, Horacio Mena<br/><br/>Count Team: Mitch Green, Connor Cimmiyotti, Tomas McKay, Will Ludan, Paulette Sherry<br/><br/>A side note on the Willow Warbler - this is a Eurasian warbler species that had not yet been documented in the lower 48 states until last Tues, October 18, when Rodeo Lagoon bird-monitor William Legge crossed paths with it next to the lagoon, popping around the Coyote Brush and Willows.  Several hundred birders have continued some surveillance of this vagrant songbird since Tuesday.<br/><br/>After a few days of being in a bit of shock, I want to pause here to honor the passing of Dr. Dave DeSante last Tuesday, in the small valley east of Rodeo Beach known as North Valley, while he was looking for the Willow Warbler with friends. Thought to have suffered a heart attack, Dave was quickly reached by emergency responders from both NPS and Marin Fire - but could not be revived.<br/><br/>Dr. Dave DeSante was an internationally-known ornithologist from west Marin, one of a band of highly productive and influential conservation biologists at Point Reyes Bird Observatory (now Point Blue Conservation Science) in the 1970s-1990s, and the president and founder of the Institute for Bird Populations.  Dave was a huge influence on many of us in the conservation biology community through his creative intellectual approaches, his mentoring, and organizational talents. He moved the MAPS (Monitoring Avian Productivity) station concept from being a West Marin PRBO thing to being an invaluable tool for long-term monitoring songbird populations, which the USFS, NPS, and other government conservation agencies wholly embraced. He was a shaker-mover for Partners in Flight and the Western Bird Banding Association, where we sometimes crossed paths. <br/><br/>Dave was on the first GGRO Scientific Advisory Committee in 1986, advising our NPS-Parks Conservancy team on how best to set up the counting and banding programs for maximum scientific impact. His own output of scientific articles, many of them ground-breaking and based on wide collaborations, was amazing. He was also an expert on (among many things) vagrancy in songbirds, and he advanced some interesting theories about off-course behaviors and migratory "traps" such as the Farallones and outer Point Reyes.  Check out the listing for Dave's scientific articles at Google Scholar. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Dave DeSante was a kind and friendly person who treated colleagues with warmth and camaraderie, and although I didn't know him well, whenever our paths crossed, he always made me feel like a long-lost friend. Thank you, Dave - <br/><br/>

<p>GGRO Hawkwatch, fun fact #1: Just when you think you have learned the patterns in the weather, the fog will throw you a curveball.<br/><br/>After the last few days of clear skies and yesterday's crackling heat, our hawkwatch team anticipated the best views of the Bay Area atop a balmy Hawk Hill. The fog had other plans. As we prepared to start the count, an inversion layer mantled the mouth of the San Francisco Bay, and the cooling 10-mph winds raced from the east. In the hours that followed, the winds shifted to the west, allowing the fog to creep closer and higher, giving us tantalizing views to the west and north until finally pouring over the entire Hill at 2pm.<br/><br/>GGRO Hawkwatch, fun fact #2: Red-tailed Hawks always find the best thermals over Kirby Cove.<br/><br/>It was quieter on the bird front today, and most kept their distance from the Hill. However, we enjoyed an hour of mostly adult Redtails riding the thermal elevator over Kirby Cove before dispersing in various directions -only to return to Kirby and do the same thing all over again. One of these adult Redtails was a beautiful dark morph Redtail! Another couple of birds that joined the elevator game were a handful of Broad-winged Hawks and several Red-shouldered Hawks.<br/><br/>GGRO Hawkwatch, fun fact #3: We absolutely love what we do, and even after days when the raptors morphed into fog, we look forward to the next opportunity to see many more!<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleader: Christine Carino & Gretchen Zantzinger<br/><br/>Count Team: Pat Contaxis, Michaela Figari, Jim Yampolsky, Pauline Yeckley, Laura Echávez<br/>

<p>Another day of clear skies and 360-degree views atop Hawk Hill. A low haze lingered in the distance early in the morning, but we could still see the North Farallon Islands to the west and Mt. Diablo to the east. By noon, the northeasterly wind was non-existent and the temps were already in the mid-80s. It was a balmy afternoon and the team had to pause the count for 30 minutes while we waited for the breeze to pick up -which it did, just a little, during the last hour.<br/><br/>The lack of wind did not bring many raptors, but some of the ones passing through did give us some great looks! A few of the highlights include Merlins and Peregrine Falcons, and for both species we had some spectacular close-ups right over the team. We also observed a few more Broad-winged Hawks and eight Red-shouldered Hawks. One of the Redshoulders was a beautiful adult that circled under Slacker Ridge for a few minutes before joining a small kettle of Turkey Vultures, eventually breaking off towards San Francisco.<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleader: Don Bartling & Erica Harris<br/><br/>Count Team: John Davis, Sue Morgan, Laura Echávez<br/>

<p><br/>A spectacular sunrise with layers of saffron and tangerine striated through the eastern sky, underlining that the Marin Headlands would not in fact be fogged in today.  A cold dry wind flexed from the NE from the start of the day with temps in the mid 70's eventually crawling up to 83-degrees by 1 pm.<br/><br/>The raptor flight was great today - much of it coming at eye level on Hawk Hill, but with some birds on the higher flight line, now technically referenced as the Fanucchi Line, which refers to a flight line of raptors that materializes some 1000+-ft overhead (or more), and where raptors are mere shapes and wingflaps.<br/><br/>Highlights today included a few more Broad-winged Hawk sightings to add to the already amazing 2022 total (545 sightings as of Oct 17) for this unusual species in our state. Also inspiring today to see 5 of the 6 possible Buteo species at the Golden Gate, -- Ferruginous and Swainson's being the special soaring hawks of the day.  Juvs of both species made close west-to-east passes in the afternoon.  Many adult accips around - but still small overall numbers of Coopers and Sharpshins for this season.<br/><br/>A juvenile Bald Eagle made a 5-min circle over Rodeo Lagoon in the mid-day before cutting northward for better fishing perhaps.  Ten mins after closing the count at 3 pm, we picked up a juv Golden Eagle along Wolfback Ridge above Sausalito.

<p>We were greeted with sunshine on Hawk Hill this morning and the count turned out to be thrilling and, at times, exhausting! There was a slight eastern wind, which shifted to a west wind around noon.  <br/><br/>When birds are seen above our heads we typically yell out "5th quadrant", tilt our heads up to the furthest extent, and cross our fingers for a cloud or speck to use as a reference point. Today we would have really benefitted from some lounge chairs, more spotting scopes, and a better look!  <br/><br/>There is an exceptionally good chance that we spotted a Northern Goshawk today. The bird was first picked up in a scope just east of Hill 88, did a few fluid accipiter flaps before it tucked into a glide, journeyed far above our heads, and trailed off above San Francisco... Farewell! <br/><br/>We finished off the day with two Golden Eagles, an Osprey, and a handful of accipiters that kept appearing as we were packing up and heading off the hill. How are we supposed to walk away from all the excitement? Oh yes, the day must end at some point, and we get the chance to do it all again soon... Looking forward to it all! <br/><br/>-Krista Fanucchi, GGRO Assistant Biotechnician <br/><br/>Dayleader: James McDermott <br/><br/>Count Team: Linda Schneider, Roy Pisetsky, Deborah Crooks, Jan Ambrosini, Krista Fanucchi <br/>

<p>No fog on Hawk Hill today; that is accurate, this is not a typo! A high cloud ceiling and light winds provided decent hawkwatching conditions, though numbers were still a bit low. The team observed 32 hawks per hour, 160 individuals and 10 species total.  <br/><br/>Today challenged hawkwatchers to stay alert as birds were spotted low, far, high overhead, heading in all directions, and with little consistency on flight patterns or paths. We are still seeing some Broad-winged Hawks, two of which were dark morphs. The usual groups of Red-tailed Hawks, Red-shouldered Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and Accipiters were spotted between bursts of activity and flight from smaller flocks of passerines.

<p>We had high hopes of getting a count in today, but the fog had other plans. Our team headed down to Rodeo Lagoon, where we actually saw some raptors, including a young Red-tailed Hawk, a vocal Red-shouldered Hawk, and a couple of accipiters: a large female Cooper's Hawk and a speedy Sharp-shinned Hawk. After unsuccessful attempts to find the vagrant Vermillion Flycatcher, we decided to take a look at the Hill -where the velvet white enveloped with permanence.<br/><br/>While we continued to wait for the fog to lift, the Hawkwatch team ventured out to Battery Mendell. We explored the historic site and managed a few sightings of Peregrine Falcons zipping through the coastal air currents. Before facing the reality of no hawk count for today, we stopped at the overlook on the way to the Point Bonita Lighthouse, where harbor seals rested on the rocks. Maybe tomorrow the fog will lift...<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleader: Mary Malec & Brian O'Laughlin<br/><br/>Count Team: Jeff Boissier, Alex Cox, Rasia Holzman Smith, JJ Harris, Carmen DeLeon, Laura Echávez<br/>

<p>With the Headlands shrouded in a thick blanket of fog high and low, we noted our visibility from the parking lot of Hawk Hill to be just about next to nil. Cautiously navigating the one way road, we paused often for rabbits and quail crossing. The fog seemed to lower in just the time it took to drive into the visitor center lot. Our team ventured off to look for a Vermilion Flycatcher recently spotted nearby, but we didn't see or hear it. We kept hiking onward to the Bobcat Trail and got a glimpse of two Great Horned Owls resting in the eucalyptus trees. Say's Phoebes hunted the hillsides and we watched a Red-tailed Hawk tuck and dive above. The screeches of Red-shouldered Hawks echoed from the trees above Rosenstock Road. As our stomachs started to call for lunchtime, we celebrated getting our steps in for the day and shuffled back to check for the flycatcher one more time before ending with a picnic. <br/><br/> <br/>Let's hope for a strong gust to move this fog on through for brighter skies tomorrow! <br/> <br/><br/>-Carmen DeLeon, Conservation and Community Science Program Coordinator <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Libby Rouan and Holly Thomas <br/><br/>Count Team: Sonja Raub, Conner Cimmiyotti, Horacio Mena, Yvette MacDonald, Carmen DeLeon <br/>

<p>Hawk Hill was completely overcast this morning and the plodding 1.6-mph winds coming from the northeast did not signal the most optimal migrating weather. However, the looming fog never completely enveloped the Hill, and the Hawkwatch team finally enjoyed a full day of counting birds!<br/><br/>We were graced by the adult female Peregrine that has been perching along the South Platform as she patrolled the area, escorting many migrating raptors out of the area. Even the Merlins that flew past the counters today were traveling at speeds faster than their usual speed of light. Another exciting sighting was that of a juvenile Golden Eagle that rose from the large radio towers to the north, suddenly disappearing from view, only to re-materialize over Slacker Ridge. Less than an hour after, another young Golden flew over Hawk Hill! Despite the migration season being past what we call the "Accipiter peak," Sharpies and Coops are still passing through, more adults now than before. Other migrants that are a little behind their peers are Broadwings -one of which was a stunning dark morph juvenile today.<br/><br/>Overall, a beautiful day to watch the migrating raptors!<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleader: Allen Fish (sub for Christine Cariño)<br/><br/>Count Team: Bob Blumberg, Arden Bucklin-Sporer, John Davis, Susan Greef, Carmen DeLeon, Laura Echávez<br/>

<p>The fog lifted around 11 and the team had enough visibility to enjoy 4 solid hours of counting and observed 8 species at 38.75 hawks per hour! We noticed more adult Sharp-shinned Hawks than usual, as they quickly flew overhead and drifted in and out of the fog. An adult Peregrine perched on the corner of the South platform before swiftly taking off to pursue a flock of Band-tailed Pigeons. The only "sunshine" in sight today was the flash of feathers from a Yellow-shafted Flicker, a rare sighting up here on Hawk Hill. <br/><br/>The hawkwatch crew eagerly counted down the last 20 minutes, as the fog thickened, and the winds increased around 2:45pm; grateful for the birds seen but also longing for warmth or a hot beverage.

<p>Thick deep fog this morning in the Marin Headlands. The count team did some birding at the east of Rodeo Lagoon, picking up many local species, also one Virginia Rail, 6 Greater White-fronted Geese, male N Harrier, a Gadwall, 8 W. Bluebirds, and assorted passerines. This morning also, the GGRO banding team got a look at the Tropical Kingbird (seen yesterday also) on the wires around Ft Cronkhite.<br/><br/>Enough fog backed off Hawk Hill that we started a regular count (with limited visibility) in the noon hour.  By 2 pm, the fog smothered the Hill again being pulled up the slope by 25-mph gusts from the west.  Some nice birds during the 75-minute count, including several gangs (2-3 birds) of Sharpshins and two Broad-winged Hawks.<br/><br/>After closing the count, a few of us talked in the Hawk Hill parking lot and around 3 pm, were treated to a pair of adult Peregrines repeatedly contouring the south-facing slope of Hawk Hill possibly to scare up a WC Sparrow snack.  The falcon flybys were a lovely punctuation mark on a foggy-windy day.<br/><br/>-	Allen Fish<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Andy Bradshaw, Mary Kenney<br/><br/>Count Team: Chris Tarr, Jody Newman, Rich Eliason, Allen Fish<br/><br/>

Closely listening and pausing at every chip, chirp, buzz, and sputter...  <br/><br/>We stopped for lunch along the north end of the Rodeo Lagoon and observed a Tropical Kingbird repeatedly lift from the same perch to catch insect's midair, occasionally switching positions with a Say's Phoebe and Yellow-rumped Warbler. <br/><br/>We are looking forward to next time!    <br/><br/>-Krista Fanucchi, GGRO Assistant Biotechnician <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Deborah Crooks, Linda Schneider <br/><br/>Count Team: Linda Chambers, Patty Lessard, Peter Sapienza, Denise Peck, Krista Fanucchi <br/>

<p>The fog maintained a tight grip on the Marin Headlands today. As we drove up to Hawk Hill, the drizzle dampened our windshields -and our spirits.<br/><br/>Even though we did not manage to count raptors, we enjoyed a peaceful walk around Rodeo Lagoon, where Western Bluebirds, Eared Grebes, Bushtits, and many others went about their birdy lives. The team attempted a last look at the Hill during lunchtime as we sat in a circle on the Middle Platform. At 12:50pm, the winds picked up, howling and pushing thicker fog onto the platform, prompting our descent out of Hawk Hill.<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleader: Becky Olsen & Ken Wilson<br/><br/>Count Team: Maggie Montenegro, Ana Maria Olivar, Kinley Renger, Carol Weinstein, Allen Fish, Laura Echávez<br/>

Staying optimistic, we went to the hill and set up for counting at 10 AM so that we could be ready for another round of Broad-winged Hawk kettles. As the fog thickened, the team soon became waterlogged in mist and we left the hill at 1 PM accepting that our 0.2 miles of visibility weren't going to open up as in previous days.

<p>First, a pre-blog announcement: no Mississippi Kites appeared over the Marin Headlands today, but we sure looked, as did at least another half dozen birders from the center platform. Thanks to Mark Dettling and Steve Howell for the heads-up.  We will keep a tight watch for the next few days.<br/>There are three previous records for autumn Mississippi Kites over the Marin Headlands: 1976, 2003, and 2008.<br/><br/>A lovely thin veneer of fog accented the Marin Headlands, the high buildings of SF, and the tippy-tops of the GGB towers this morning. A skink's breath of wind from the east, and the Broad-winged Hawks started up right away. The no-wind became west wind and grew through the day until it was gusting to 12 mph, and blowing the fog back in.<br/><br/>Throughout the day, flocks formed and dispersed and reformed; they gathered into kettles, sliding into the bottom, and gliding off the top, and then re-assembled a mile away. Again and again. We tracked these carefully to avoid recounts as well as they could be tracked.<br/><br/>Often the Broadies co-flocked with Turkey Vultures, and these flocks gathered up a few accipiters, some Redshoulder, Redtails as well.  Fog came and went throughout the day, and engulfed the western slopes of the Hill by 3 pm.<br/><br/>Late in the day, a flock of 23 Broad-winged Hawks coalesced into a tight whirl of birds, perhaps 30 feet wide and 100 feet tall, right over the Rifle Range, just west of Hawk Hill.  It was lit perfectly by late day sun, and was one of the most beautiful views I have ever had of birds anytime anywhere.  The flock turned and turned for about two mins then the bulk of the hawks streamed southward over Hawk Hill's western flanks and disappeared into the fog toward San Francisco.<br/><br/>-	Allen Fish<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Horacio Mena, Holly Thomas<br/><br/>Count Team: Connor Cimmiyotti, Will Ludan, Paulette Sherry, Mitch Green, Allen Fish<br/><br/>

<p><br/>Thursday started in fog and it ended in fog, and - oh yeah, there was a lot of fog in the middle.  We had near full clearing in all directions in the mid-day, perhaps for an hour or 2, but the day was a kind of art gallery of fog with every fog-spill, blanket, mental-fog, pea-soup, wispyness, every fog variation you could imagine. <br/><br/>Winds were quiet in the morning but were blasting from the west after 1 pm - gusting up to 15 mph.  Temps stayed between 60 and 72 through the day.<br/><br/>The usual hawks showed up - Redtails, Cooper's, and Sharpshin, especially the latter, but the headliners were Broad-winged Hawks and Turkey Vultures. Most of the Broadies were working thermals in flocks of 10-20, with similar-sized vulture flocks also working sometimes mingled with the Broadies, sometimes in species-specific flocks.  These flocks provided thermal "markers" for other raptors as well, so Sharpshins and Coops and small falcons would jump in, ride the elevator up and then peel off to the south.<br/><br/>Beyond getting a daily count, this was just a beautiful day for watching the dynamics of flocking raptors and micro-weather patterns.<br/><br/>-	Allen Fish<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Gretchen Zantzinger, Christine Carino<br/><br/>Count Team: Bob Blumberg, Pauline Yeckley, Patricia Contaxis, Michaela Figari, Carmen DeLeon, Allen Fish<br/><br/>

<p>Fog soup persisted in the Marin Headlands til way past noon, but these pockets of blue started to show over the east, so the team started the official count at noon.  The visibility was bipolar, with 0.2 mile visibility to the west, and Mt Diablo visible (32.2 mils) to the east.  The fog retreated gradually in the first hour revealing most of the eastern and northern ridges and the SF skyline, and ... oh yeah...<br/>a few Broad-winged Hawks.  <br/><br/>As soon as the fog lifted there were Broadies underneath.  First there were six, then there were 16, a bit later, 24.  We spent the afternoon acting as Broad-winged Hawk traffic monitors.  How many in your kettle?  Any adults or dark morphs? Is the column moving left or right?  Look, three Broadies just peeled off the top to join those Redtails.  Watch for Sharpies in-between the Broadies.<br/><br/>Just like with Turkey Vultures, accipiters seem to use Broadwing flocks as markers to gauge where lift is happening.  Thermals, updrafts - it's all good.  Fun especially to watch a tiny male Sharpshin soar speedily upward among a dozen Broadwings.  I know the eastern hawkwatchers see this all the time, but in California, most of our Broadwings are singles, so when we finally get a group together, the flock-flying behaviors are downright mesmerizing.<br/><br/>Lots of Sharpshins today as well, including a few adults - fun to see the gray backs in bright sun.  A few other singles of different species, but this was a Broadwing and Accipiter Day to be sure.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, except for the Palm Warbler - which landed among the Baccharis bushes on the summit of Hawk Hill in the mid afternoon and spent a few hours popping from shrub to ground to shrub, tilting its long tail and nibbling bugs.

<p>Tuesday at 9 am started with a big old gray down jacket of fog covering 900-ft Hawk Hill - down to about the 300-ft level.  The Team did some birding on the Rodeo Lagoon Trail, picking up lots of birds in the Coastal Scrub and Willows, including two Western Kingbirds near the Old Bowling Alley (just above the now-defunct MH Visitor Center.)<br/><br/>By 12:15 the Hill looked near-clearing, and we started counting Broadwings and Sharpshins immediately as the fog rose up and away.  But that lasted about 12 miins.  Fog came back almost as quickly as it rose, and most of 2.75 hours of counting were with less than 1-mile visibility.<br/><br/>In spite of that, we had a steady steam of "under the canopy" Sharpshins, mostly flying on their thumbs, aka, epaulets, aka alulas.  And a few close-ups of other species: Harrier, Merlin, Coop.

<p>The hawkwatch crew was greeted this morning by a slight breeze, blue skies, and Sharp-shinned Hawks! The flight started to pick up as we were wrapping up our morning meeting, and we got a couple of close looks at Broad-winged Hawks as they passed overhead and lifted in the breeze.  <br/><br/>Many birds were spotted as they quickly rose above Rodeo Lagoon, climbed into the 5th quadrant, and drifted out towards the Presidio. Head on, a Ferruginous Hawk, holding its wings raised in a dihedral, flew towards Hawk Hill and soared above our heads and in the direction of the Golden Gate. This sighting was a highlight for many hawkwatchers at the end of the day, though our heads were left spinning from all the exciting 5th quadrant activity. Lots of Peregrine Falcons too!

<p>There was a high cloud ceiling and a light breeze this morning, but the flight started to pick up as the conditions changed and winds increased around 1:00pm. Most of the flight was way up in the 5th quadrant (straight up), tiny specks passing through small clouds and fading in and out of the blue. Hawkwatchers were left spinning as they spotted birds in the north, followed the flight overhead, and quickly turned to watch the bird trail off towards the Golden Gate Bridge and beyond.<br/>  <br/>Broad-winged, Red-shouldered Hawks, a couple of Northern Harriers, and many Accipiters kept us on our toes, as we scanned and sometimes strained for a better look; thankful for the few wispy clouds overhead that could be used as reference points while describing location, instead of just yelling "bird overhead, straight up, right there!"<br/><br/>Although, at times, that is the best we can do.<br/>  <br/>-Krista Fanucchi, GGRO Assistant Biotechnician <br/><br/>Dayleader: Sam Hontalas <br/><br/>Count Team: Laura Coatney, Melissa Kohner, Rod Santos, Courtney Buechert, Ryan Overhiser, Krista Fanucchi, Allen Fish <br/><br/>

<p>It was a foggy morning up at Hawk Hill, so the Hawkwatch team ventured down to Rodeo Lagoon -hoping that the blanket would quickly dissipate.<br/><br/>Pygmy Nuthatches, Western Bluebirds, Great Blue Herons, and many Brown Pelicans were amongst the 26 bird species seen. We had a fair share of raptor sightings as well! We heard a pair of adult Redtails over the Marine Mammal Center as they rose in a tight circle, feet down, in a sweet courtship display. A male Kestrel hovered right over us, likely foraging for some imperceptible rodent or camouflaged grasshopper. Though we never made it to Hawk Hill, we had a lovely end to the walk as a member of the team spotted a pair of sleeping Great-horned Owls just below the canopy of eucalyptus trees. <br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech <br/><br/>Dayleader: Mary Malec & Brian O'Laughlin <br/><br/>Count Team: Alex Cox, Rasia Holzman Smith, JJ Harris, Carmen DeLeon, Laura Echávez<br/>

<p>A light haze dusted the city and bridge as we approached the hill of clear skies and sun. Wind was nowhere to be found and it was a warm morning with the day ranging from 70-74 degrees F. With a slow start to the raptor flow, we enjoyed a good look at an adult male Northern Harrier- the infamous "grey ghost." Though the birds were slow at first, we were happy to see the first group of the season of Migratory Story students enjoying the lower viewpoints of Hawk Hill. We love welcoming our future raptor biologists! <br/><br/>An ever so slight 2 mph breeze started the migration flow. Kestrels danced through the sky up the cables of the Golden Gate Bridge and our midday excitement included watching Osprey glide across the valley and the lagoon. We hoped that the Broad-winged Hawk kettles from yesterday would continue, and indeed they did! Several kettles drifted in from Mount Tam as we patiently waited for them to get closer. We marveled at their flight pattern of small circling groups that reminded us of a mobile of birds on invisible strings. It was wonderful to see kettles of 5 or so birds being joined by Turkey Vultures, accipiters, and Red-tailed Hawks as the floated over Slacker Ridge toward the bay. A distant Golden Eagle was spotted in the northwest, and though we kept hoping it would come closer, it continued onward into the greenery toward Tam. <br/><br/>During the last hour of the day, foghorns bellowed as thick fog blanketed the southeast and started to cover the lagoon in the west. A strong breeze of 10-12 mph from the west brought a flurry of Sharp-shinned Hawks near and far as the counters were tallying right up to the last minute busy with birds. <br/><br/>Carmen DeLeon, Conservation & Community Science Program Coordinator <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Holly Thomas & Libby Rouan <br/><br/>Count Team: Laura Thomas, Sonja Raub, Connor Cimmiyotti, Horacio Mena, Allen Fish, Carmen DeLeon <br/>

<p>Warmer temps and leisurely winds cleared up the skies, quickly dissipating the early morning fog. The gusts picked up during the last hour, reaching up to 9-mph, but with birds blasting over the Hill all day long, it was evident the wind was not needed.<br/><br/>The theme of the day was kettles of mostly Broadwings with a mix of Redtails, Coops, and Sharpies that rose over Slacker Ridge and slowly drifted towards the Golden Gate Bridge. The first Broadwing kettle of the morning emerged when the Hawkwatch team was getting ready to start the count! After that, we eagerly anticipated an exciting day -and the raptors delivered! The morning's highlights include a fleeting look at a White-tailed Kite and a few Merlins, one of which was snacking on a winged arthropod in flight. Noon had its own set of excitement; a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk rose from Gerbode Valley and made straight for the Bridge followed two minutes later by an adult Bald Eagle on the same trajectory. Lastly, the final hours of the count did not fall short of raptors either... even a sub-adult Swainson's Hawk and a couple of female Kestrels circled a few times before continuing their southern migration.<br/><br/>Overall, a spectacular day enjoyed by the Hawkwatch team and all the raptor afficionados that made it to the Hill today.<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleader: Christine Cariño<br/><br/>Count Team: Pat Bacchetti, Bob Blumberg, John Davis, Susan Greef, Carmen DeLeon, Laura Echávez<br/>

<p>Despite foggy conditions, the count team still managed to observe some great birds as they passed Hawk Hill from all angles and directions. We had decent visibility for the first couple of hours, as the edge of the fog stayed close to the hill and was thin enough to spot some Broad-winged Hawks, American Kestrels, Merlins, and many Sharp-shinned Hawks as they rose and barreled over our heads. It was a rare sighting to spot one Sharpie at a time, as they all seemed to be trailed by two...three...or six more accipiter's; tumbling with talons out at times. Rapid barrel rolls and aerial rivalry, we love the drama and display up above!  <br/><br/>We were greeted this morning by a group of students from USF who were on a field trip with their ornithology class. As much as we are fascinated by raptor ecology and movement, we are also thrilled to see how young biologists navigate and grow.

<h2><a name='20220927'/>Tuesday, September 27, 2022</h2>
<p>Tuesday morning started with a high gray canopy of clouds over the Marin Headlands, a definite improvement over the dense fog of the last 2 days as the hilltops were actually visible. Winds started NE today but floated to NW by late afternoon, and mostly 64- 70 degrees and few clouds by 3 pm.<br/><br/>Sharp-shinned Hawks were contour-flying around the cars as we arrived at 930 am, so we made the call to get up and start counting pronto.  But not until after a moment of silence and acknowledgement for the heroic event of 60 years ago today: Rachel Carson's hugely impactful book, Silent Spring, was published.<br/><br/>Silent Spring links directly to the world of raptor migration as Rachel Carson used data from Hawk Mountain, PA, to provide evidence of the human and environmental disaster that was (and is) DDT.  The migration counts from Hawk Mt - given to Rachel by Maurice Broun in 1960 - showed a clear decline of Bald Eagle numbers post-1948 (year 1 of DDT use in the Northeast) and primarily a decline in juvenile birds.  Why juveniles?  Because DDT specifically attacks the reproductive system of female birds. So juveniles declined faster than adults.<br/><br/>Today, the Marin Headlands raptors came out in honor of Silent Spring and Rachel Carson - we had an incredible flight on Hawk Hill: 640 raptor-sightings, with 14 different species including four falcon spp. The flight began immediately this morning - Broad-winged and Sharp-shinned Hawks especially numerous, but also Cooper's, Redtails, and some Redshoulders started appearing among the patchy clouds under a light NE breeze.  <br/><br/>Falcons showing up gradually with many direct south-bound flybys of Merlins and Kestrels. Twenty Kestrel sightings for the day!  A pair of adult Peregrines chasing the accipiters around, but a few juv Peregrines as well. A few Osprey and two Ferruginous Hawks plus four Harriers and a White-tailed Kite gave us a great range of species.<br/><br/>- Allen Fish<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Andrew Bradshaw, Mary Kenney<br/><br/>Count Team: Woody Woodbury, Jody Newman, Chris Tarr, Dan Foldes, Rich Eliason, Allen Fish - special thanks to NPS biologists Ana Arce and Morgan Barnes for joining us today and contributing some awesome spotting.<br/><br/>

<p>Foggy conditions on Hawk Hill this morning sent the count team down to mingle with the many Yellow Warblers at Rodeo Lagoon. We returned to the hill around noon to check the weather status and enjoy our lunch downslope from the East quadrant, and we were pleasantly surprised to see many passing Accipiter's and a Broad-winged Hawk. We considered these observations as a good sign that we could get a couple hours of counting in for the day. So, that is exactly what we did!  <br/><br/>And what a rich and productive couple of hours it was... Sharp-shinned Hawks were catapulting up over our heads, through every quadrant, then fading into the mist. A few Merlins' buzzed Hawk Hill, also trailing off into the clouds and quickly out of sight. Though the count team was on their toes and busy with the Raptor display above, we still had a moment to spot and observe the yellow-green crown and back contrasting with the gray face/chest/belly of a Chestnut-sided Warbler as it foraged in and out of the Coyote brush near the North quadrant. As the count team was descending the hill, a Northern Harrier teetered our way and accompanied us on our way out.

<p>The fog layer hovered over the Marin Headlands all day, but the velvet white lifted enough for us to start the raptor count by 11AM. Temps started and ended at 59-degrees F, reaching a max of 62F at noon. However, the early morning breeze quickly turned to 15-mph gusts that catapulted Sharpies overhead while the team scrambled for their puffy layers.<br/><br/>Even though the fog never fully lifted, we had many decent opportunities at viewing some incredible behaviors. To start off the day, a flock of ~40 Band-tailed Pigeons rushed over Kirby Cove, when an adult Redtail slowly descended upon them, feet down, and snatched a pigeon mid-air! What a feast that must have been for the Redtail! That was not the only raptor with prey on its mind though. We also observed a Peregrine Falcon swooping on potential prey -it dove straight towards the ground before making sharp U-turns in its attempts.<br/><br/>The strong winds fast-forwarded birds from our view, not only the Sharpies, but Kestrels and Merlins as well. Even the larger species were no match against the turbulent air. Whether they meant to or not, a handful of Cooper's Hawks zipped by today, while a young Northern Harrier rode the wind as it gracefully seesawed towards the south. We hope for sunnier days on their journey and on the hawkwatch days ahead!<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleader: Becky Olsen & Ken Wilson<br/><br/>Count Team: Ana Maria Olivar, Kinley Renger, Carol Weinstein, Allen Fish, Laura Echávez<br/>

<p>Was today a day...or was it really 3 days in one?  While it stayed right around 68-72 degrees F throughout the count time, the sunshine, wind, and fog brought us distinct phases of weather conditions with varying raptor flow. With dry air, bright sunshine, and zero wind it seemed like we could be in for a hot day with few raptors. An early sighting of a dark morph Broad-Winged Hawk that sailed in from the north and soared above the bay was a delight for all!  <br/><br/>Thankfully, the west wind finally woke up in the early afternoon with a gentle 3 mph breeze and absolutely clear skies. Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures began moving in small kettles over the Golden Gate and into the East Bay. Accipiters trickled through mixing in with the soaring kettles. As the breeze picked up, we were surprised to see 3 Merlins in a single hour each flapping fast (as MERLs do!) around the hill and across the bay. <br/><br/>Later in the afternoon, those in North had clear skies while thick fog crept through the lagoon and loomed below the hill. As pillowy fog replaced our views of the ocean and bay in the southwest, the wind picked up to 10 mph. While visibility was limited in some areas, the fog seemed to push a flow of accips with Sharp-shinned Hawks fluttering fast in the wind and banking through the fog around the hill. We were excited to compare sharpies and coops side by side and get to finish the day with a fairly active hour. <br/><br/>Broadwing and Sharpie fans- we see you!

<p>A gentle NE breeze in the AM hours turned to a light east wind, then nearly dead air after 2 pm. By 230 pm, we had a rousing west wind, and with it, some more accips to finish the day with. AM temps started at 72-deg and finished at 80-deg at 3 pm.<br/><br/>In our first half-hour an adult female Peregrine chose to alight on the railing at the west end of Hawk Hill and study the waters of the Golden Gate 900 feet below. She allowed us to watch her for some 10 mins before making an intercepting flight to catch up with the adult male travelling by at, well, falcon speed.  The two soared, flapped, and glided around the sky for a good 15 mins, forcing us to watch their every wingbeat, their flight configurations, and the various colors shone by the angle of the sun.  It was a terrible ordeal, but what can you do? Finally they flew off, allowing for a few more Sharp-shinned Hawks to fly cautiously across the sky.<br/><br/>This wasn't a fast migration today. And much of it was quite high up. And never dull. We had great close looks at a juvenile Osprey (with white scalloped-edging on every back feather), and an adult Osprey (also a dorsal view showing multiple shades/ages of primaries and secondaries).  <br/><br/>A bunch of Red-shouldered Hawks appeared throughout the day, and a few Merlin and Kestrel flybys kept our eyes sharp.  Many dragonflies riding high thermals seemed to keep the Merlins engaged. A three-falcon day is always good. One distant, high Broad-winged at the end of the day was a nice bit of frosting on the cake. <br/><br/>-	Allen Fish<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Horacio Mena, Holly Thomas<br/><br/>Count Team: Will Ludan, Tomas McKay, Connor Cimmiyotti, Allen Fish<br/><br/>

<p>Standing at the Hawk Hill parking area before making our way up to the count site, the team enjoyed a stream of Sharp-shinned Hawks. They carried the promise of a more "normal" peak day for the program -and regardless of whatever normal means, we certainly had an amazing day on the Hill.<br/><br/>The warmer temps and southern winds brought a wide array of raptors, and we finished the day at 11 species! In addition to the numerous Redtails and Turkey Vultures, a few other species were also sighted various times. Broadwings, Redshoulders, Ospreys, and Merlins were among the most exciting events! Oftentimes, many of the birds we see are far away, but maybe because of the slow winds today, a lot of them soared right over the team. Even a juvenile Golden Eagle circled right above, showing off the beautiful chocolatey colors and white patches!<br/><br/>Other highlights also include some non-raptor migrants. Large flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons fluttered south within the first couple of hours of the count, and Vaux's Swifts zoomed by in big numbers throughout the entire day. Finally, 21 Monarch Butterflies also dashed across the Headlands, often being initially confused for a gliding Sharpie and impressing the team with their speedy flight!

<p>Another day of magnificent cumulus clouds! The gentle southwest wind averaged around 5-mph and the cool temperatures did not rise above the mid-70s. Despite the less-than-optimal winds, today's flight included a diverse array of species, and it appears that the Accipiters are finally arriving.<br/><br/>After a steady trickle of Sharpies throughout the day, the final hour felt chaotic. For every pair of Redtails we saw, a Sharpie appeared... as if on cue. A total of 48 sightings of the smallest Accipiter were recorded today -more than doubling the season's numbers thus far! The Cooper's Hawks trailed behind by quite a bit, but enough to allow for opportunities to compare the two.<br/><br/>Some other highlights include Peregrines dive-bombing young Redtails; a Merlin flying fast past Slacker Ridge; an adult Osprey headed straight for Golden Gate Park; and finally, a handful of Broadwings -a couple of which circled high over the team before continuing along their lengthy migration route!<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleader: Don Bartling & Erica Harris<br/><br/>Count Team: Sam Hontalas, John Davis, Holly Thomas, Laura Echávez<br/>

Temps stayed in the 68-78 degree window, depending on the amount of cloud cover at any given moment.<br/><br/>A fair day of Redtails, mostly flying the Slacker Hill/ridgeline over Sausalito, with some brief showings by Redshoulders, Peregrines, a Merlin, and a few Accipiters - although not many of the latter.  <br/><br/>The insectivores were out in force today from Blue-gray Gnatcatchers to Vaux's Swifts, from Flame Skimmers to Blue Mosaic dragonflies.

<p><br/>Following yesterday's splendid storm, today's morning skies featured lines of cumulus that would make Andrew Wyeth jealous: forty-five variations on white, gray, pewter, and bruisy black clouds piled high over Mt. Tam, the GG Bridge, and the East Bay Hills. Gorgeous.<br/><br/>The wind started at SE and turned to SW by late morning.  Temps stayed between 64 and 70-deg for the day.  A full-on west wind didn't take form until after 1 pm, but the hawks were intermittent all day long. A little quiet for September 19th - but the diversity was wonderful.  Close looks at Merlin, Peregrine, Redshoulders - and a half dozen accips.<br/><br/>Dayleader: James McDermott<br/><br/>Count Team: Deborah Crooks, Roy Pisetsky, Linda Schneider, Jan Ambrosini, Kimberlie Moutoux, Allen Fish<br/><br/>

<p>It is hard to believe I am sitting here, writing about something other than the fog. Hawkwatch was cancelled today due to... rain! Though we typically expect a flooding of Accipiters at this point in the season, we do welcome any form of precipitation we can get around here. And I must say, the approaching storm clouds contrasting with the ocean blue-green at Rodeo Beach was truly beautiful this morning.   <br/><br/>-Krista Fanucchi, GGRO Assistant Biotechnician <br/>

<p>Beautiful distant clouds, blue skies, gentle 5-mph winds... oh, and a Broad-winged Hawk! What better start to the day? In addition to the Broadie, the first hour of the count brough a series of exciting raptors! A Red-shouldered Hawk rose from Gerbode Valley and quickly flap-flap-glided southwards. Two Peregrine Falcons guarded the entrance to the Bay as they sat atop the suspension cables of the Golden Gate Bridge. Cooper's Hawks fought the steady western winds as they rose in unison with the Redtails over the valley.<br/><br/>The rest of the day was sprinkled with moments when a hawkwatcher would yell for an interesting bird and the entire team ran from different corners of the Hill -binoculars ready- to catch sight of the visitor. Soon after each of these occurrences, periods of little activity followed, allowing discussions on what we had just observed. One of these was not long after midday, when a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk appeared behind a handful of Redtails circling directly over Hawk Hill! Another highlight was the brief appearance of a Prairie Falcon spotted from the west low near the old rifle range and zipping out of the Headlands.<br/><br/>During the last hour, the fog crept back into the Bay and around the Hill, and strong gusts of cold wind reminded the team of the looming storm. It may be quiet on the raptor front for the next couple of days...<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleader: Mary Malec & Brian O'Laughlin<br/><br/>Count Team: Alex Cox, Rasia Holzman Smith, JJ Harris, Melissa Hero, Carmen DeLeon, Laura Echávez<br/>

<p>This morning welcomed us with dense fog, but we saw the sun shining on the ocean and knew that it could shape up to be an excellent day on the hill. Our team observed a gopher excavating on the hillside, causing small rocks to slide down, as we waited for the sky to clear. With the fog becoming patchy and the wind picking up, we headed to the hill and started counting at 10:30 AM. The temperatures ranged from 62-73 degrees F with patchy fog clearing to warm, blue skies around 1:30 PM. A steady wind from the west around 8-12 mph brought the beginning of the raptor flow we were most excited to see. <br/> <br/>Though we were off to a slow start, we were delighted to see accipiters rising in the north and west with some great looks at Sharp-shinned Hawks side by side. An osprey gliding across Angel Island to the Golden Gate and several Red-shouldered Hawks made for a very fun afternoon!  <br/><br/>A special shout out to the students of Downtown High School from the Wilderness Arts and Literacy Collective. We wish you happy birding trails and appreciate you coming to the hill to learn about raptors. Don't hesitate to fly our way again soon!

<p>A wispy fog capped Hawk Hill this morning, but it slowly drifted upwards throughout the day, giving way to a 360-degree view of the San Francisco Bay and the Marin Headlands. A steady 10-mph gust persisted for a couple of hours but slowed down after noon as the temps settled in the low to mid 60F.<br/><br/>Even though we are entering the peak of Accipiter migration, we have not observed them in their usual numbers. Fortunately, today's team had a streak of luck and saw the highest number of Accipiters seen so far as both Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks graced the Hill -a total of seven of each! However, the day got even more exciting right before lunchtime when a Broad-winged Hawk, our smallest Buteo, materialized out of the fog directly over the count site. Around that same time, a juvenile and an adult Peregrine Falcon perched on the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge, but the adult quickly chased the young bird off the bridge and into the city.<br/><br/>That would not be the only falcon species seen today though... A Merlin was spotted from the south as it pursued a White-throated Swift before making a straight line into San Francisco. Just as the day was coming to a close, our fearless leader, Christine, spotted an ephemeral Kestrel over Gerbode Valley, making this a three falcon species day!<br/><br/>The cap to the day was a juvenile Bald Eagle that appeared over Mount Tamalpais and flew right over us before disappearing into the glare of the city.<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleader: Christine Cariño<br/><br/>Count Team: Pat Bacchetti, Bob Blumberg, John Davis, Susan Greef, Carmen DeLeon, Laura Echávez<br/>

<p>Well, it came rolling in from the West and did not give way. We got fogged out!  <br/><br/>Hawkwatchers met on the South side of Rodeo Lagoon to discuss Accipiter ID, hoping that the conversation and consideration would summon them our way. We then took a slow walk along the lagoon, stopping to peak at everything that flickered and flew from Willow to Cypress and back again. As we stood in the middle of a Eucalyptus grove, attempting to get a closer look at a couple of Warblers, a Great-horned Owl spread its wings and flew right above our heads before disappearing behind dense vegetation. We had been standing there for a few minutes or so, and had not noticed our feathered friend perched out on a limb, though it was surely watching us...  <br/><br/>-Krista Faucchi, GGRO Assistant Biotechnician <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Don Bartling <br/><br/>Count Team: Linda Sudduth, John Davis, Sue Morgan, Jan Ambrosini, Joan Duffield, Krista Fanucchi <br/><br/>Outreach Support: Tim Stroshane <br/>

<p>A thick fog lifted from Hawk Hill just about 9 am this morning, but it was not in a hurry to leave.  The fog wrap lingered throughout the day occasionally obscuring Tamalpais from view, and San Francisco as well.  Gusts from 8 to 20 mph out of the west, and temps from the mid 60's to 70-deg.<br/><br/>Not the break-out Accipiter day we have been waiting for but we did watch a steady stream of Red-tailed Hawks flap, glide, truck, cavort and careen across the sky mostly toward the SW. Other species highlights included 2 Sharp-shinned Hawks, 1 Merlin (first of the year for this little falcon), and an Osprey. In the morning, an adult Peregrine made several long sweeping stoops on the center summit of Hawk Hill trying to budge a too-sturdy covey of California Quail out of their coyote brush. Hats off to prey and predator for doing their best in this million-year-old dance.<br/><br/>Thanks to GGRO banding manager Teresa Ely, banding dayleader Anne Ardillo, and bander Cricket Raspet, we enjoyed a mid-day banded Red-tailed Hawk release in honor of George Eade, the beloved GGRO volunteer, raptor conservationist and photographer who died in late July.  George's hawk was a intricately field-marked lighter-light morph juv Redtail that calmly rose from Teresa's release into the eye-level of the Hawkwatch, then spent some 5-10 mins just stilling next to Hawk Hill, eight binocular pairs transfixed.<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Andy Bradshaw, Mary Kenney<br/><br/>Count Team: Chris Tarr, Rich Eliason, Dan Foldes, Woody Woodbury, Jody Newman, Allen Fish<br/><br/>

<p>Hawk Hill was cloaked in fog this morning, leading hawkwatchers to begin the day with the familiar discussion of "I think it is just about to lift" ... "We must be right on the edge of the fog" ... "It will definitely clear out soon" ... and my personal favorite "I really have no clue what the fog is about to do". <br/><br/>West winds eventually picked up around noon and we enjoyed a solid 4-hour count. Red-tailed Hawks were seen hovering above Slacker ridge, stooping beyond middle kingdom, and soaring high overhead before trailing off in the direction of the Golden Gate Bridge. A Peregrine falcon was spotted in the Slacker saddle, and three Osprey gave hawkwatchers quite the show as they soared steadily in wide circles over Hawk Hill and beyond.  <br/><br/>The last bird of the day was also the only Accipiter we saw today!

<p>What a beautiful day it was on the Hill today. The day started with an easy breeze and fog mantled over the entrance to the San Francisco Bay. For the first couple of hours, our Hawkwatch team saw a steady trickle of Redtails and Turkey Vultures, but we were hoping for some species variety -and, geez, did the raptors deliver!<br/><br/>This has been an unusually low year for Accipiters, particularly Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks. So when a juvenile Cooper's Hawk flew in a from the west and then rose over the north quadrant, all those atop Hawk Hill cheered with excitement. Then, not ten minutes after, a Swainson's Hawk rose from Gerbode Valley and circled higher with a few juvenile Redtails. Lastly, to top off the hour, a distant Osprey flew over Alcatraz Island, decidedly making its way south for the winter. The final hour of the count brought more highlights, including Peregrine Falcons and a misty Northern Harrier.<br/><br/>As the team was leaving Hawk Hill, an adult Cooper's Hawk flew right over us -could this be a sign of the Coops and Sharpies yet to come?<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleader: Becky Olsen & Ken Wilson<br/><br/>Count Team: Paul Meadow, Maggie Montenegro, Ana Maria Olivar, Kinley Renger, Carol Weinstein, Laura Echávez<br/>

<p>Dense fog kept hawkwatchers from Hawk Hill this AM, so we spent the morning among the Wilson's Warblers and river otters along the south side of Rodeo Lagoon until the fog began to lift around noon.  <br/><br/>Back up on Hawk Hill, gusts of 15-20 mph sent Red-tailed Hawks up and over Slacker ridge, down into Gerbode Valley, summersaulting over our heads, and trailing off into the mist. A couple of Cooper's Hawks, steady in flight and somewhat unfazed by the wind, were seen among a group of Red-tailed hawks and tumbling Ravens.  <br/><br/>One distant falcon was seen only moments before disappearing into a veil of heavy mist...

Essentially one per minute for the first two hours.<br/><br/>A few other species rounded out the day - several great Red-shouldered Hawk views, a handful of Coopers. We have still no Sharpshins on the official count, although a few have been seen around the valley this week. And today, 15 mins after closing the count, a Redtail and Osprey thermaled up together over the Rifle Range and shot the gap east of Hawk Hill heading for parts far to the south.<br/><br/>-	Allen Fish<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Libby Rouan, Holly Thomas<br/><br/>Count Team: Horacio Mena, Sonja Raub, Yvette MacDonald, Laura Thomas, Connor Cimmiyotti, Allen Fish<br/><br/>

<p>As we made our way up to Hawk Hill, a blanket of fog enveloped Gerbode Valley and the mouth of the San Francisco Bay, the still air trapping the velvety inversion layer.<br/><br/>It was a quiet morning. During the first hour of the count, we had more non-raptor sightings than anything else as flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons, White-throated Swifts, and Blue-gray Gnatcatchers rushed by. We enjoyed a handful of Turkey Vultures, several Red-tailed Hawks, and a sprinkle of novelty species for the team: one Cooper's Hawk, one Northern Harrier, and an American Kestrel. The second hour of the day brought flurries of Redtails, mostly juveniles that zigzagged back and forth over Slacker Ridge -foreshadowing the theme of the day... However, it also brought an exciting bird and a first for the 2022 season: a Swainson's Hawk! It hugged the count site and lingered around the Hill for quite a while, giving the team plenty of time to "Ooh" and "Ahh" at its fascinating field marks. A cool and gentle northwesterly breeze picked up around noon, and for the rest of the day we mainly saw Redtails, interrupted by a distant Osprey, a Red-shouldered Hawk on a mission, and the occasional Turkey Vulture.<br/><br/>A handful of visitors enjoyed the sight of the migrating hawks as well -some folks local to California and a small family from as far away as Poland! All in all, it was a beautiful day to be on Hawk Hill!<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleader: Christine Cariño<br/><br/>Count Team: Pat Bacchetti, Bob Blumberg, Arden Bucklin-Sporer, John Davis, Susan Greef, Laura Echávez<br/>

<p>While the count team was wrapping up the morning meeting, a Sharp-shinned Hawk rose above Hawk Hill and flickered off into the Golden Gate. Did we consider this sighting an early indicator that it would be a great day of Hawk counting? YES we did and it was, truly...  <br/><br/>Hot weather and light, NW winds put birds high in blue skies for most of the afternoon. A sub-adult Bald Eagle accompanied by two Red-tailed Hawks, a swift Peregrine Falcon, a teetering Northern Harrier, and a high energy American Kestrel reminded me of how incredibly lucky we are to witness migrating raptors.    <br/><br/>As I was packing up the gear and heading out for the day, I noticed a person looking intently at the sky with a smile stretched across their face. I turned to see a Juvenile Red-tailed Hawk soaring in a wide circle right above our heads, tilting its wings slightly to catch the breeze as two Ravens positioned themselves right behind the Hawk. This person asked what we were looking at, still smiling wide, and after learning that it was a Red-tail they simply responded "wow, this must be my lucky day", as they stood there staring until the bird lifted and disappeared out of sight. What a gift, to be overcome with gratitude. To be awestruck by a fleeting moment... <br/><br/>-Krista Fanucchi, GGRO Assistant Biotechnician <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Don Bartling, Jon Altemus <br/><br/>Count Team: Linda Sudduth, John Davis, Sue Morgan, Jan Ambrosini, Joan Duffield, Krista Fanucchi <br/>

<p>A near-full wrap of fog at 10 am turned to wide open skies by 1130, and a continual flyby of Red-tailed Hawks for the whole day - with a great assortment of other characters.  Highlights included a juv Peregrine which made several visits and flashed its sooty colors, a stunningly close juv Bald Eagle with tiny little Redtails escorting it from Hawk Hill out over Kirby Cove.  Eight species in all. Temps stayed at or under 70-degrees, and gusts up to 15 mph never relented.<br/><br/>Awesome to have Brian Westlund (NatureBridge) and Francis Taroc (Parks Conservancy) up on Hawk Hill today with 23 new NatureBridge instructors for the annual 2022 teacher training in the Middle Platform.

As the wind started to pick up, so did the birds!  <br/><br/>The count team enjoyed the opportunity to observe a few Cooper's Hawks and a Northern Harrier, as well as the familiar Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures.

<p>A magical sight from Hawk Hill: pockets of blue sky! After holding our breath while submerged in fog for 5 days, the western winds pushed the rolling mist high above the Hill.<br/><br/>Although some of the fog swirled around us -threatening to completely obstruct our view- for nearly 4 hours, our team enjoyed the teetering Turkey Vultures and soaring Red-tailed Hawks. Around 1pm, an adult Redtail rose in front of Angel Island and quickly turned, stooping for a critter too small for our team to see. When it took flight again, its talons held proof of its hunting attempt!<br/><br/>The end of August (and Fogust) approaches, and the warmer weather that follows will surely bring many raptors on their south-bound journey.

<p>I am sitting here, reaching for another way to describe the dense white mist; that creeping and persistent "thing". It is as if Hawk Hill has been so wrapped up in fog that it simply refuses to let go. I believe there is some sort of hidden shackle, binding these two. Or perhaps it is just... Foggy!  <br/><br/>Retreat to East Rodeo Lagoon! The Hawk count team observed Red-necked Phalaropes swimming in tight circles and Black Phoebes darting out to catch insects' midair. We watched Common Yellowthroats bounce around through thick vegetation as we mulled over the familiar question of "I wonder what the weather is looking like up on the hill"... Am I bitter? No, still feeling lucky to be immersed in it all.

<p>Today gave us another Marin Headlands fog-drape of Hawk Hill and the surrounding peaks; a white-out complete with authentic, wet moisture on the ground.  <br/><br/>The Friday GGRO count team passed some time at Rodeo Lagoon and had great looks at River Otters (6), Red-necked Phalaropes (26), Common Yellowthroats (6), Marsh Wrens (2), and singles of many other species: Long-billed Curlew, Greater Yellowlegs, Red-tailed Hawk, a fabulous Peregrine Falcon flyby, and lots of the regulars: egrets, herons, scrub habitat songbirds, cormorants.<br/><br/>The hawkwatchers did make it up to Hawk Hill by noon and we did every dance imaginable to get the fog to retreat, but temperature, wind, and ocean are far greater powers, and we called it an official fog-out at 1 pm. Perhaps a clear Hill tomorrow?<br/><br/>I am thinking today of the thickest fog and the wildest birds. I am thinking of one of my oldest and dearest Marin Headlands naturalist friends, Laura Pettibone, who died earlier this week. Feeling still and alert to old things, I re-found this Robinson Jeffers poem, aptly titled "Fog":<br/><br/>Invisible gulls with human voices cry in the sea-cloud<br/>"There is room, wild minds,<br/>Up high in the cloud; the web and the feather remember<br/>Three elements, but here<br/>Is but one, and the webs and the feathers<br/>Subduing but the one<br/>Are the greater, with strength and to spare."<br/> <br/>-	Allen Fish<br/><br/>Dayleaders: Horacio Mena & Holly Thomas<br/><br/>Count Team: Will Ludan, Paulette Sherry, Conner Cimmiyotti, Tomas McKay, Mitch Green, Allen Fish<br/><br/>

<p>It was a great day for a detour! With Hawk Hill submerged in fog well after 1pm, we took our binoculars to a more active location: East Rodeo Lagoon! The usual Brown Pelican pod bobbed on the surface while the Red-necked Phalaropes foraged in the pungent waters of the lagoon. Meanwhile, a river otter weaseled its way around the raft of pelicans as it gnawed on some shelled creatures. Great Egrets, Snowy Egrets, a Great Blue Heron, Barn Swallows, a Black Phoebe, and Common Yellowthroats were also a part of the show.<br/><br/>This is a hawkwatch team, however, and raptors were indeed the highlight for today! Hoping to see signs of clearer skies on Hawk Hill, our team ventured into Gerbode Valley, and came across a family of Great Horned Owls! We heard begging calls from the juveniles, but the parents did not entertain their requests.<br/><br/>- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech<br/><br/>Dayleader: Don Bartling<br/><br/>Count Team: Stefanie Arthur, John Davis, Sue Morgan<br/><br/>

The limited visibility rendered a somewhat slow day, however, even on the slowest of days, you can always count on Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks to make an appearance.<br/><br/>Around midday, the teetering fog allowed us to get good views east of the Hill, where we spotted a dark morph juvenile Redtail circling high over Angel Island! Not too long after that, a Red-shouldered Hawk and a Cooper's Hawk also came into view. The highlight of the day was an adult Peregrine Falcon that materialized out of nowhere and stayed long enough for us to appreciate its beautiful slate-colored plumage.

<p>Rain! Sunshine! Fog! A flash of Blue Sky! Hawks! The weather up on Hawk Hill today was erratic, at one moment you had your eyes fixed on something, and the next your view was obstructed by a dense layer of fog. Strong, steady winds had some of us questioning our decision to only bring a few extra layers up to Hawk Hill for the day. One thing is for sure, the gusts shook us to our core and reminded us that migration is on.  <br/><br/>For today's count, we observed 20.5 birds per hour. Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures appeared in kettles of up to 7 birds at a time over Slacker ridge and rose steadily beyond the Golden Gate bridge. A Cooper's Hawk blew up and over the hill and disappeared in a glide and into a veil of fog. A Northern Harrier, with its fluid and relaxed wingbeats, was seen carrying off a western fence lizard.  <br/><br/>Dayleaders: Don Bartling, Jon Altemus <br/><br/>Count Team: Linda Sudduth, John Davis, Sue Morgan, Jan Ambrosini, Joan Duffield, Krista Fanucchi <br/><br/>Outreach Support: Tim Stroshane <br/>

<p>Today's GGRO hawkwatch was greeted by warm, still skies, but gradually turned to a fog-wrap with a 300 ft-ceiling on three sides of us and gusts up to 13 mph. The great finger of Pacific fog extended into the Golden Gate and had piled up against the center span by 2 pm.<br/><br/>We had a decent count day with more than 26 raptors per hour (rph) driven by gangs of juvenile Redtails, as many as six in a kettle at once.  A few Cooper's Hawks made early-season appearances, and an adult Peregrine capped the day at just 5 mins before quitting time. This blue-backed falcon zoomed onto the Pt. Diablo slope and then soared above Kirby Cove for a long 3 mins, before disappearing to the south. Lots of Blue-Gray Gnatcatchers about as well.<br/><br/>Hawk Hill visitors today were from Oakland; Berkeley; Davis; Toronto, Canada; Toulouse, France; London, UK; and Moscow, Russia. One morning highlight was meeting Ricardo, a Parisian man riding his motorcycle from NW Territories to Argentina in 5 months. We marveled that he was matching the migration of our longest distance species - the Peregrine Falcons. He was happy to attach a GGRO sticker to the back of his bike.
