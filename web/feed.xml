After filling up on delicious food in the office and recalling some amazing hawk sightings on the Hill, we decided to brave the conditions on the top of the Hill for a final goodbye. The team caught a group shot in the North quadrant just as the fog and drizzle really started to come in. We are thankful for all of the wonderful hawks and laughs shared together on the Hill and look forward to meeting up again at the banquet. Happy end of 2015, Sunday II team signing out for the season!&lt;br/&gt;

Saturday II redeemed themselves in their last outing, logging two hovering American Kestrels and two close-soaring juvenile Ferruginous Hawks to make up for earlier fog out days. A highlight of the day included looks at a juvenile Northern Harrier, a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk, and an adult Red-tailed Hawk all in a single binocular field. These good views, alongside an impressive feast, made for a thoroughly enjoyable last day of the season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BEYOND BIRDING: Lots of chilly minutes standing in our respective quadrants left us time for history lessons in the geology of the Bay. Did you know that the Bay as we know it is only tens of thousands of years old? Prior to being flooded at the end of the last ice age, Native Americans walked all the way to the Farallones, about 30 miles away. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

We enjoyed our potluck while being entertained by close flying adult Peregrine Falcons, abundant adult Red-tailed Hawks, and one sub-adult Bald Eagle! The eagle flew right over us with a raven in hot pursuit, allowing us to get a look at its very ragged-looking molt. Weather was very pleasant with light winds and temperatures in the low 60's, making it a lovely day for human and canine Hawkwatchers alike. &lt;br/&gt;

However, we didn't anticipate the day starting off with a very close female adult Peregrine Falcon greeting us as we began setting up. She was soon joined by another adult, and the pair (likely the Kirby Cove residents) defended their turf against intruders, including a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk and a migrating adult Peregrine Falcon. Between munching on chili, salad, homemade hummus, lemon bars, and our Rough-legged award-winning pizza, we spotted three juvenile Ferruginous Hawks and an extremely dark morph adult Red-tailed Hawk. Our season finished dramatically as a juvenile Bald Eagle appeared at 3:32, just two minutes late to be included in the official count. It was nevertheless an exciting finale for the last day on the hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, temperatures were consistently in the 50's, with moderate winds fluctuating between the north and east. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

We kept warm with hot chocolate and coffee along with a bounty of homemade treats. While the winds blew predominantly from the north and northwest, they did not carry many migrating raptors our way. We mostly counted Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks, but did get some very nice looks at adult Peregrine Falcons flying right above the Hill. We were especially entertained by the antics of Hawk Hill's resident Ravens, White-crowned Sparrows, and Wrentit as they tried to sneak up to our potluck spread and steal crumbs. We left the Hill at 1:00 once the rain began again and the flow of birds seemed to have completely dried up. While Monday II's season went out with a fizzle in the drizzle, we enjoyed each other's company and our tasty snacks and look forward to reuniting at the banquet in January!&lt;br/&gt;

We started the day off right with an adult Peregrine Falcon circling over the platform. Raptor number climbed steadily throughout the day, peaking in the early afternoon. Today, the Common Ravens were fiercely defending their territory harassing a sub-adult Golden Eagle from low in Kirby Cove all the way to Mount Tamalpais. They also relentlessly pursued a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk that hid in the bushes in the south quadrant for five minutes before booking it across the San Francisco Bay. On the non-bird front, a large wedding party and a large choir induced traffic jams on the Hill and in the parking lot. The Hawkwatchers kept warm by munching on cheese and crackers and drinking coffee as the temperatures ranged from the high- 40s to low-50s. Sunday I is thankful for another great season!&lt;br/&gt;

Gusts of frigid wind from the East kept Hawk Hill a consistent 50 degrees, but provided for excellent visibility throughout the day. Enduring this extremely chilly weather earned great looks at adult Peregrine Falcons, most soaring around and above the Hill for several minutes and a pair diving repeatedly at an adult Red-tailed Hawk.  Buteos were also out and about despite the strong winds, and we sighted a handful of gorgeous dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks in addition to a most interesting raptor that we all wished had come closer: an adult rufous-morph Ferruginous Hawk. Saturday I was grateful to have such a lovely last day among incredible raptors and looks forward to next year!&lt;br/&gt;

The day started out with strong winds and temperatures in the high 40s, but the birds did not take fright. Early in the 10 o'clock hour, Hawkwatchers were surprised to see a very late season Osprey over Wolfback Ridge. This sighting lifted our spirits as the frigid winds froze us to the bone.  However, the Osprey was not the most exciting bird of the day. At around 10:45am, a scream boomed from the East, &#147;I think everyone needs to look up!&#148; Holly's call caused everyone to turn around and see the pointy accipitrine wings and the long tail of a Northern Goshawk soaring right above the east quadrant. As the day continued temperatures went up and the wind died down and we were blessed with three Ferruginous Hawks, including one adult, eight Peregrine Falcons and another Osprey. Along with great hawk sightings, 445 visitors joined us on the Hill today(that's 74.2 people per hour)! All in all, today's the count was not extremely high, but it was definitely one of the most memorable this year! We certainly have a lot to be thankful for on Friday I. &lt;br/&gt;

The chilly winds blew predominantly from the north, with shifts between northwest and northeast. We began the day right with a close-up sighting of a White-Tailed Kite. Although the usual suspects showed up in lower numbers (Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and Accipiters), we had enough variety to keep us interested, including three long, luxurious looks at Ferruginous Hawks. Add Ann's delicious pumpkin pie, along with a variety of other tasty treats, into the mix, and we couldn't have asked for a nicer Thanksgiving!&lt;br/&gt;

The weather alternated between cold and fairly warm with temperatures in the mid-50's and winds from several directions. We saw several Peregrines, including one that went after a Ferruginous Hawk. The thrill of the day was seeing a juvenile Northern Goshawk released by Hawk blind!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GGRO Goshawk Fact: This is only the 6th goshawk that has been banded in the history of the program! Banders and Hawkwatchers alike were delighted to experience this rare visitor to the Headlands.&lt;br/&gt;

Today's temperatures remained in the mid-50s throughout the day. The winds on the Hill did not prove quite as cold or harsh as we feared and brought us some excellent looks at Peregrine Falcons and truly spectacular looks at our trusty Red-tailed Hawks, including George who was close enough for us to read his expression through the scope. But the bird of the day was a Prairie Falcon which popped up in the west to demonstrate its hover hunting skills before zooming off. A great way to end our season!&lt;br/&gt;

While we never got to official Hawkwatching, we still made the most of our last day. We started off in the GGRO office with a cool presentation by Allen about Harlan's Hawks. Afterward we went to Rodeo Lagoon to do some birdwatching: we saw lots of American Wigeons with a few Eurasian Wigeons mixed in, as well as Northern Shovelers, Goldeneyes, a few grebe species, a Bufflehead, and a Wilson's Snipe. Next we went on a walk on the Miwok trail, where we saw several Red-tailed Hawks, a female American Kestrel, and some more waterfowl. After waiting in the cold fog at the Annex and hoping the Hill would clear off, we ended up hiking up the hill one last time to warm up with some exercise and enjoy a potluck to celebrate our Monday I team. We warmed up with hot chili, pizza bread, salad, and delicious baked goods, including pumpkin pie. Thanks for a great season, everyone!&lt;br/&gt;

Due to the previous day's count, the team was psyched to scan for hawks. Though today's count was not as hefty, we made up for it with great company and incredible mammalian sightings. Multiple porpoises swam though the Golden Gate, three whales were spotted beyond Point Bonita, and large flocks of Homo sapien touristi were seen on the summit of Hawk Hill. Throughout the day, many Red-tailed Hawks flew extremely close to the Hawkwatchers. When the day's count started to dwindle at 2:00, a Ferruginous Hawk surprised us in the North Quadrant. Although Thanksgiving is this Thursday, the Sunday II team is looking forward to a delicious banquet on our and GGRO's last Hawkwatch day of the season.&lt;br/&gt;

Despite balmy breezes at 1064, we found ourselves in 15 to 20 mph winds until the early afternoon, after which they calmed. Fortunately, temperatures were consistently in the mid-60s, which kept us comfortable. Overall, the conditions may have helped us along to the highest count since November 4. Our tally consisted primarily of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures, peppered with the occasional look at rarer birds, including a juvenile Bald Eagle and several American Kestrels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Highlights included a close look at a subadult Golden Eagle, a first for this team this season, and &#147;yet another&#148; juvenile Ferruginous Hawk.

Although the count wasn't too high, the Thursday II crew still managed to spot 10 species including three White-tailed Kites and four adult Cooper's Hawks.  A number of birds demonstrated proper migration technique, catching thermals right above the platform before zooming south towards The City.  A Merlin also passed close overhead and, based on its uneven tail feathers, we could tell it was an adult that had molted.  In the second to last hour, Hawkwatchers were treated to a dark-morph juvenile Harlan's Red-tailed Hawk. &lt;br/&gt;

Although our number of raptors counted was relatively low, we compensated with an interesting distribution of species: more Northern Harriers than either Sharp-shinned or Cooper's Hawks, as well as sightings of a Bald Eagle, a Ferruginous Hawk, and several very cooperative Merlins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BALD EAGLE (SOUND)BYTE:  Did you know  that the Bald Eagle has a far from impressive call?

In addition to the first Rough-legged Hawk, we also completed the fuzzy leg trifecta with an adult Golden Eagle and a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk. Other highlights of the day included a light blue-gray female Peregrine Falcon, two White-tailed Kites and a 360-degree virtual reality experience. You may question what we mean by this, well we are baffled by the same question. Upon arrival at Hawk Hill, Hawkwatchers were greeted by a student film crew equipped with an amplifier, camera equipment, and dancers on the center platform.

The wind gusted up to about 10 mph and predominantly blew from the north and northwest, bringing chilly temperatures to Hawk Hill. Although the thermometer read in the mid-50's for most of the day, warming up to the low-60's in the afternoon, the wind-chill made us feel much colder. Visibility was amazing, however, as we had great views all the way to San Jose. We mostly counted Red-tailed Hawks today, split evenly between about 35 juveniles and 35 adults. While the long-awaited Rough-legged Hawk was still nowhere to be seen and we were also not visited by any Ferruginous Hawks, we were treated to two White-tailed Kites and 13 American Kestrel sightings. We also got some great views of Peregrine Falcons over the city and swooping up onto the Golden Gate Bridge.&lt;br/&gt;

However, these predictions proved to be false when winds never reached above 25 mph (at the edge of the North Quadrant).  Bird activity varied throughout the day with the largest amount of birds seen from 10-11am.  There was heavy Peregrine Falcon activity between 2-3pm, with 7 total seen throughout the day.  A juvenile Bald Eagle provided some excitement in the early afternoon. First believed to be a distant Turkey Vulture, it eventually rose up in the West Quadrant and revealed its large size in comparison to the stooping Red-tailed Hawk.  &lt;br/&gt;

The weather was pleasant despite the odd air quality, with temperatures in the mid-60s and low 70s and very light, variable winds, practically nonexistent until a mild West wind kicked up in the afternoon. As small kettles of Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and Ravens formed and dissipated throughout the day, our vigilant Hawkwatchers kept an eye out for unusual raptors. Much to our luck, an Osprey and a White-tailed Kite were spotted at a close distance, in addition to several nearby Northern Harriers. The three typical falcon species also graced the Hill with their presence today, including a gorgeous male American Kestrel who enthralled us as he circled over our heads.  The Rough-legged Hawks spotted at Pt. Reyes may not have decided to move Southward today, but we'll be ready for them when they do! &lt;br/&gt;

Eleven of the 252 Red-tail sightings today were of dark morph birds, making it a little more exciting to see the migrating Buteos. Speaking of exciting Buteos, one solitary Swainson's Hawk was seen today, a rare sighting for this time of year in the Headlands. Most of these birds have already moved on from the Central Valley to South America. Hopefully this loner makes it in time to meet up with its family for Thanksgiving in Argentina!&lt;br/&gt;

We had minimal winds primarily out of the north and west and temperatures in the high 50s and low 60s. The precipitous drop in accipiters was obvious today: in total, we spotted only 23 Sharp-shinned Hawks and 6 Cooper's Hawks. Given that the bulk of our count consisted of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures, we were happy for spurts of variety, including several Merlins, a handful of Red-shouldered Hawks, a blackish dark morph Red-tailed Hawk, and an adult female Northern Harrier. &lt;br/&gt;

Although numbers were low, we did have nine Northern Harrier sightings and a beautiful view of a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk silhouetted against the Golden Gate Bridge. An extremely low-flying plane kicked up the adrenaline level and made our team question whether or not to duck out of the way. Thanks to some high-powered optics, we were able to get the registration number off of the plane and call it into the parks dispatch. &lt;br/&gt;

We were treated to many great looks at adult Peregrine Falcons, including a very pale individual that may have been from the Tundrius subspecies. One Peregrine even obliged us with a flyby near enough for some close-up photos. Northern Harrier juveniles were the other highlight of the day&#151;we saw six juveniles and one adult male.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PONDERING PEREGRINES: Peregrine Falcons, or Falco peregrinus, include many subspecies (up to 19 have been accepted by bird guides). Of these, we see three. The Tundrius subspecies was first described by C.M. White in 1968 and is paler than our other subspecies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The morning started out "knock-you-down windy," with winds from the north and a constant flow of birds to go with it. When the winds died down in the afternoon, the birds got scarcer. Temperatures were in the 50s in the morning and the 60s in the afternoon. It was big day for Red-tailed Hawks with 270 sighted, including 11 dark morph juveniles and two dark morph adults. Also exciting was having a Double-Eagle day! We had two Bald Eagles, one juvenile and one adult, and one adult Golden Eagle. Even though we were missing our Dayleader, Allen, we had a great time on the hill. The only negative was spotting a drone in the air over Hill 88. Headlands visitors should remember, it is illegal to fly drones in all National Parks, so please find a more suitable location to fly your devices. &lt;br/&gt;

Temperatures ranged in the sixties and the slight wind consistently blew from the west-south-west throughout the day. While the number of raptors remained fairly low, today was a great day for spotting a wide variety of species. During the morning meeting, this team reminisced about this day one year ago when 15 species were spotted. While we only reached 11, we did spot the very first Bald Eagle of the season. This bird appeared in the Northeast, and was identified as a juvenile by its brown breast and belly and white wing-pits.  Another exciting moment of the day was when an adult Peregrine Falcon chased a juvenile right over Hawk Hill, giving amazing views of these beautiful birds and great photo opportunities. At the end of the day, Dayleader Mary's wish to see a White-tailed Kite finally came true, as this team spotted one in the West quadrant for Tuesday II's first time this season. This was a great last day before the interns leave for the Raptor Research Foundation Conference in Sacramento. The blog will pick back up on Monday, when we return to the Headlands!&lt;br/&gt;

Throughout the day, the sun battled the fog, but ultimately it surrendered. We started out the day at the Annex and moved to Hawk Hill at 10:30. However, the Annex gave us a better show than the hill. While Hawkwatchers watched an American Kestrel in Kirby Cove, a Peregrine Falcon appeared behind it. Though it did not bother the Kestrel, the Peregrine Falcon decided to complete a series of dives on the resident adult Red-tailed Hawk pair. Once we made it up to the hill, the day was very slow with only 27 sightings and three species.&lt;br/&gt;

Luckily, a westerly wind blew in during the early afternoon, cooling us all down from temperatures in the mid-70s to high 60s and bringing the highest number of birds we've seen in a few days. These included excellent looks at close-flying Accipiters, especially adults. Other highlights included many Red-tailed Hawks and several Northern Harriers showing off their pumpkin bellies, just in time for Halloween!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRICK OR TAIL? Did you know that the GGRO experiences a second peak of Red-tailed Hawks, typically in early November? Look out for those extra beauties as they fly over Hawk Hill!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Our Accipiter proportions were similar to our peak counts were, with approximately three times as many Sharp-shinned Hawks as Cooper's Hawks. Many of these Sharp-shinned Hawks were heading directly south across the Golden Gate, leading to lots of &#147;undocumented&#148; age class birds. With the bright light reflecting off the water in the east and south, it was difficult to make out the plumage to distinguish juveniles from adults. A dozen Merlin sightings added excitement to the day, as did multiple adult female Northern Harrier sightings. A juvenile Golden Eagle was sighted in the afternoon, answering the team's morning wish for &#147;an eagle, any eagle!&#148; &lt;br/&gt;

Temperatures ranged from the low sixties to mid-seventies, with clear skies throughout the day. The wind began in the northeast and east in the morning and later shifted to more westerly directions. This weather brought greater numbers of both individual birds and species than had been seen recently. Today was a great day for falcon-viewing, as we saw lots of American Kestrels, Merlins, and Peregrine Falcons, many flying close by over the hill. We saw both adult and juvenile dark morph Red-tailed Hawks, along with a likely Harlan's Hawk. Unfortunately, this bird with unusual plumage did not give us a good enough look to be certain if it was this rarer type. Intern Elan introduced a number of school groups to Hawk Hill, and the hawks treated the students to some awesome close views.&lt;br/&gt;

Throughout the day, the wind never picked up and temperatures remained in the mid-70s to low-80s. Wind direction predominated from the east, but changed occasionally to the south. These unfavorable weather conditions limited the number of hawks we observed.

Red-tailed Hawks were the heavy hitters of the day, with 142 sightings, including a beautiful, very light juvenile male who gave a lovely show during the banding demo. The light markings on his back and some black breast feathers led Hawkwatchers to discuss whether he might just be an intergrade between a typical Red-tailed Hawk and a Harlan's Hawk, a Red-tailed Hawk subspecies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HARLAN'S HISTORY: Formerly considered a separate species, the Harlan's Hawk was reclassified in 1973 as a subspecies of the Red-tailed Hawk. It is characterized by a lack of rufous coloration and more black feathers on the upperparts, as well as barring on the outer primaries in juveniles. There is a stable zone of intergrade between Harlan's Hawks and typical western Red-tailed Hawks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Unfortunately we weren't able to spot this Eurasian species, but we did see some visiting fall ducks and had a nice walk before heading up to check out the visibility up top. Fog still shrouded the peak of Hawk Hill so we spent some time waiting at the Annex by the roundabout, where we were able to spot some raptors down in Kirby Cove and along Slacker Ridge. As soon as the hill cleared at a quarter to one we were on our way, and managed to spot seven species of raptors during the official count time. Highlights included a few Northern Harriers, zooming Merlins, and a lovely adult Red-shouldered Hawk. &lt;br/&gt;

While raptor activity overall was relatively low, we spotted 122 Red-tailed Hawks, second in numbers only to Turkey Vultures, as usual. Two dark-morph adult Red-tails were spotted in the afternoon. We were shocked and dismayed when the &#147;daily Ferrug&#148; failed to appear, and also missed the Golden Eagles that had been appearing often in the last week. We did get to see an Osprey and a White-tailed Kite, species that were a little more common earlier in the season but hadn't been seen as often lately. We were entertained by the appearance of a Raven with two large feathers sticking out at odd angles; this bird could clearly use some practice in proper preening technique. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AND NOW, THE WEATHER: Today was sunny with only a few clouds, but hazy in the distance over the city. The haze and strong light made visibility poor when viewing far-off birds. Wind began in the northeast and east and shifted later in the day towards the west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Our first sighting of the day was a Merlin that ushered in a pleasant flow of birds, bringing us to about 100 raptors per hour from 11 am to 1 pm. A fairly high number of Red-shouldered Hawks (11 in total) showed off their crescents for us, while our life blood&#151;Red-tailed Hawks&#151;kept us busy throughout. Not to be forgotten, our &#147;daily Ferruginous Hawk&#148; arrived between 2 and 3 for the requisite admiration of the Hawkwatch.&lt;br/&gt;

The day began with a case of déjà vu&#133; A familiar looking raptor appeared over Slacker Ridge and the Hawkwatchers took notice. What initially appeared to be a strange Red-tailed Hawk was later recognized as a dark morph Swainson's Hawk. Perhaps, this was the same individual spotted on yesterday's watch. In the afternoon, a distant Golden Eagle was spotted in the North Saddle. While there was much debate over the age when looking through scopes, a photograph taken by one of our Hawkwatchers cleared up the matter. This individual showed both juvenile and adult feathers, indicating a second-year bird beginning its long transition into adult plumage. Along with these interesting sightings, we also observed the daily Ferruginous Hawk, the Golden Gate Bridge Peregrine Falcon and four American Kestrels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today's Weather Report: Temperatures slowly increased from the high-60s to the mid-70s around noon. A shift from eastern to western winds cooled us down in the afternoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fun Fact: The opposite of déjà vu is jamais vu, or the sensation of having never seen a familiar word before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

A total of 23 Merlins were spotted today as they zipped by the Hill, moving south in a hurry! The day started slowly, with winds from the south and east, bringing some interesting birds into south quadrant (but not much elsewhere). Temperatures ranged in the comfortable high 60s and low 70s throughout the day. Around noon, the wind shifted to the southwest and, surprisingly, numbers began to pick up and a slew of uncommon and unique birds flew by the Hill. Our daily Ferruginous Hawk appeared around this time, continuing the surprising streak of sightings throughout the season. Hawkwatchers applied the weekly intern presentation on aging Golden Eagles to not one, but two, Golden Eagles that were seen today! As the 2:00 hour began, everything became a blur as the sky filled with falcons and Red-tailed Hawks. As two Peregrine Falcons locked talons, a leucistic adult Red-tailed Hawk soared above. This bird had completely white upperwing coverts, while the flight feathers and tail showed normal plumage. A bird that first appeared to be a dark-morph Red-tailed Hawk was then discovered to be a dark-morph Swainson's Hawk, one of only a few this season. The day ended with the glorious release of our second telemetry bird this year, a male juvenile Red-tailed Hawk dubbed "Gypsy". We look forward to following Gypsy's travels for the next week or so and wish him luck! You too can follow his flights at www.ggrotelemetry.blogspot.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, and swirling winds!  White-tailed Kites, Peregrine Falcons, and Golden Eagles!  Not to deviate from the current trend, a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk flew by in the afternoon.  A Peregrine Falcon also gave the Hawkwatchers a good show, repeatedly stooping on a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk.   Adding to the drama, a small plane practically skimmed the platform in the morning and in the afternoon two drones appeared high in the skies, including one that fell and crashed into the hillside. &lt;br/&gt;

We had just enough time to count several representatives of our common species and two Northern Harriers. Unfortunately, a dense fog rolled in at 12:30, prompting us to leave the Turkey Vulture tally for another day. Hawkwatchers enjoyed watching the banding demo, given by docent Randy Breaux, before heading off the Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GULL GUFFAW: Why don't you see seagulls flying over the Bay?

One minute, raptors were flying, while the next minute, we were covered in fog (and even a few stray raindrops)! Highlights of the day included two Ferruginous Hawks and a very pale-headed Red-tailed Hawk that made some of our Hawkwatchers do a double-take. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAPTOR RHYMES: The weather today was confusing, but not as frigid as the snow storm described in the hawk-inspired poem below. Can you name the author?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&#147;No hawk hangs over in this air: &lt;br/&gt;The urgent snow is everywhere. &lt;br/&gt;The wing adroiter than a sail &lt;br/&gt;Must lean away from such a gale, &lt;br/&gt;Abandoning its straight intent, &lt;br/&gt;Or else expose tough ligament &lt;br/&gt;And tender flesh to what before &lt;br/&gt;Meant dampened feathers, nothing more&#133;&#148; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

It was an overall pleasant day with increasing sightings of adult Accipiters and another great look at a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk that did a slow pass past the platform before heading to The City.  There was an interesting sighting of a dark morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawk that was very light colored on the dorsal side.  A juvenile Northern Harrier provided a nice send-off to the Hawkwatchers, popping up just below Fish Rock during the final minutes of the count.  &lt;br/&gt;

Yet this did not inhibit Hawkwatchers from seeing some wonderful raptors. The first half-hour only had five sightings, but an adult Peregrine Falcon and a juvenile Northern Harrier gave us hope for improvement. That hope was met (and exceeded) when Natasha spotted a large, dark, non-Red-tailed Hawk&#133;.wait! It's a dark morph Ferruginous Hawk! Many agreed that this could be the best bird of the season, and all were satisfied when it gave us a lingering close-up before heading towards the Bridge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DARK MORPH DATUM: Of the species seen at Hawk Hill, all of the Buteos except for Red-shouldered Hawks show multiple color morphs, but only three percent are dark morphs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Yet, our songbird count reached 176.3 individuals per hour as large flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons and Violet-green Swallows swarmed around the hill.  Though the raptor hourly counts were low, a large variety of species were seen. This made the heat a little more bearable. During the second hour of the day, nine species were counted including a late-season Osprey and the two Golden Gate Bridge dwelling Peregrine Falcons. Along with these two species, ten juvenile Northern Harriers flew through the north quadrant throughout the day. Here's hoping for more wind and more raptors tomorrow. &lt;br/&gt;

Our dependable flow of Red-tailed Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, and Cooper's Hawks came with a consistent Northwest wind that kicked up mid-morning. Later in the afternoon, warmer temperatures generated thermals for large kettles of Turkey Vultures. We may have seen many juvenile Ferruginous Hawks in the past few weeks, but few sightings have been as spectacular as today's individual, who circumnavigated the entire Hawk Hill summit!  An adult female Northern Harrier also visited the Hill, illustrating complex hunting patterns. &lt;br/&gt;

The morning started with dense fog, but it rolled out for great visibility in the afternoon. We started our count off right with close-up views of a White-tailed Kite and a Broad-winged Hawk, both displaying their classic field marks. Our trusty Red-tailed Hawks and Accipiters ruled the day thereafter, and Hawkwatchers got in some field entomology practice, spotting approximately 40 butterflies. We also enjoyed a visit from young UC Santa Cruz ornithologists and several Audubon groups. Once the Blue Angels got going, we had several seemingly surprised birds fleeing the scene and (happily) increasing our total species numbers, including a Merlin and an Osprey!&lt;br/&gt;

Fleet Week festivities kept the south quadrant interesting as the parade of ships passed under the bridge in the morning, and a pair of gray whales could be seen feeding in the middle of the lineup. Two adult Peregrine Falcons and one juvenile sped by the south platform, reminding everyone that there were birds to be counted too. Lots of Accipiters kept the Hawkwatchers on their toes, as did several raptor ID studies from the banders at Hawk Blind. Large kettles of Red-shouldered Hawks tested everyone's scope skills from the far north, and our daily dose of Ferruginous Hawk appeared right in front of our eyes as we were working the distant birds. The afternoon concluded with the Blue Angels jets flying close enough overhead to wave to the pilots, and the team left slightly sunburned but in good spirits. &lt;br/&gt;

Raptor activity overall was low, but two pairs of adult Peregrine Falcons,  two Ferruginous Hawks, and eight juvenile Northern Harriers kept us glued to the sky. The lack of activity may have been related to the still air and warm temperatures felt in the morning, but things picked up later in the day. The peak for adult Accipiters may be approaching, as both Sharp-shinned Hawk and Cooper's Hawk adults were spotted in proportions much higher than before. A nocturnal raptor species seen today was a Great Horned Owl, oddly enough, perched on a telephone pole in the South Quadrant at 3 PM.

Two Golden Eagles! After two cycles of extreme weather, almost 100 degree heat and cold winds, Tuesday II finally had excellent hawk watching weather which brought in some terrific raptors. The close head-on view of a Broad-winged Hawk kicked off the day's excitement. Around noon, the cry of &#147;Ferruuugg!&#148; could be heard across the platform. Everyone turned to the north to see a Ferruginous Hawk hovering nearby. However, the real excitement occurred when two juvenile Golden Eagles were spotted over Angel Island. What an excellent way to celebrate Pat's four score birthday and Molly and Nick's last days on Hawkwatch. Happy Birthday (UNHHH)!&lt;br/&gt;

After two cycles of extremely hot weather, the Monday II Team was grateful for pleasant winds and a moderate temperature. We were joined by another Audubon birdwatching group eager to observe the migration and spot some unique hawks. They were rewarded with the sight of a few juvenile Broad-winged Hawks, one of which was a dark morph. Later in the day, we also were haunted by a &#147;Gray Ghost&#148;, an adult male Northern Harrier, followed by an amazing head-on view of a Ferruginous Hawk. The Hawaiian Chieftain, a gorgeous tall ship, heralded the end of the day with cannon fire as she entered the bay.&lt;br/&gt;

Accipiters were flying left and right and Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures accumulated in massive kettles throughout the day. Throw in some Merlins and Broad-winged Hawks and we had ourselves a raptor party. As the wind increased into the afternoon, our unidentified Accipiter count increased as well. Along with great sightings of hawks, many visitors came to the hill throughout the day. We had an excellent group of inquisitive guests at our Hawk Talk and Banding Demonstration. Overall, it was a wonderful day to spend on the hill.&lt;br/&gt;

The morning started off slowly, with thin fog moving in and out of the Headlands and obscuring most of the birds. The day ended with winds strong enough to blow over the strongest of Hawkwatchers! Nevertheless, we had a strong finish with over 500 raptors counted in what was really a 3 hour (rather than a true 6 hour) day. The falcon game was intense today, with multiple overhead views of Merlins and Peregrine Falcons. We even got to practice &#147;birding by the tail&#148; with several male American Kestrels. We continued to build on a larger-than-average year for Ferruginous Hawks, with three close-up sightings. Glad we got off Hawk Hill before we started losing volunteers to the wind. Thanks Saturday I and see you in two weeks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TAIL TALES: For many raptors, the outer tail feathers, technically called the 6th retrices, are a different size or color than the rest of the tail feathers. One excellent example from today on the Hill was the male American Kestrel, whose 6th retrices are white with black spots, in contrast to the rest of the tail (mostly rufous, with a large black subterminal band and a white terminal band). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Early in the morning as the count began, Hawkwatchers were treated to the sight of a Short-eared Owl that flew close enough to see clearly without binoculars right by the West and North quadrants. This excitement was followed by a steady flow of Accipiters, Red-shouldered Hawks, and Broad-winged Hawks, the latter of which provided some great views as they formed a kettle right overhead in the fifth quadrant. Fair weather brought past and present Hawkwatchers and their friends from all teams to the Hill today, crowding the North and East quadrants with scopes and hundreds of cumulative years of Hawkwatching experience. The South and West quadrants didn't feel left out, as they were entertained by humpback whales feeding and spouting off of Point Bonita.&lt;br/&gt;

The pace of activity seemed evenly spread today, with raptors graciously timing their migration to suit our identification needs! We had three glorious looks at Ferruginous Hawks, all showing off their three points of light (tail and wing windows). Northern Harriers charmed us with four chances to check out their white rump patches and pumpkin orange bellies. It was also a decent Merlin day, with four swift looks that were made better by occurring almost directly overhead. We were joined by a new team member, Caryl Carr, and got the news that our wonderful Christine Lamphear will be leaving us for new beginnings in Reno, NV. We wish her the best of luck, and welcome the very experienced Caryl to the team! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROAD-WING BROADCAST: We would be remiss if we didn't mention our excellent, close-up views of Broad-winged Hawks today on the Hill. Broad-wings are eastern migrants that, for many years, were not believed to occur in California. We've catalogued their travels over Hawk Hill for an average of about 200 sightings per season. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

A total of 12 species were seen, including one White-tailed Kite and a Golden Eagle. We witnessed a dramatic confrontation between two adult Peregrine Falcons and one juvenile right in front of the north platform-the adults took turns dive bombing the juvenile and calling loudly to chase it from their territory.  At least two Humpback Whales entertained the east and south quadrants in the afternoon by feeding and diving right in the mouth of the Bay, giving everyone a great look at tails and spouts. &lt;br/&gt;

Monday I seems to have a weather curse, as we were fogged out last cycle and 3 of our 4 days so far have been foggy! We did get a nice look at a Kestrel perched in a tree as well as some Accipiter action. Once on the Hill the fog hung close by and didn't clear until the very last hour of the day. Despite this, we were still able to see 381 raptors representing 10 different species. The special bird of the day was a dark-morph juvenile Broad-winged Hawk that flew by several times. We also had some nice looks at Merlins and juvenile Northern Harriers (pumpkin spice season is starting, after all!). At the end of the day we were treated to a pair of Peregrine Falcons chasing Ravens and showing off some spectacular stoops. While the weather was cold and windy and the HPH was lower than it has been of late, we still had a nice day and enjoyed watching the raptors we could see through the fog.&lt;br/&gt;

Lagoon sightings included: three river otters, Greater Yellowlegs, Eared Grebes, and a daring deer that walked through the middle of the lagoon.  Once we got onto the Hill around 11, activity picked up with flurries of accipiters, kettles of Broad-winged Hawks, and crowds of excited birders on the platform hoping to catch a glimpse.  The highlight of the day was the five Merlin sightings in one half hour.

Mercifully, the weather improved significantly and cleared completely by noon, making for a great day of Hawkwatch. Since this group has been fogged out twice, Hawkwatchers were thrown into peak and faired amazingly well, especially with those tough accipiter calls. Along with our excellent view of accipiters, we were lucky to see two Peregrine Falcons in the final hour; one diving on an unfortunate Sharp-shinned Hawk. And we were joined on the Hill by a posse of aspiring Hawkwatchers, all under age twelve. Their enthusiasm (and accurate birding) gave us hope for the future of GGRO. Look out for Eddie's forthcoming book of hawk photography and ID techniques, hitting stores in 2030. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FUN FERRUGINOUS FACT: In the past ten years, GGRO has counted an average of 23 Ferruginous Hawks per year. This year to date, we've already seen 16. Our data shows the peak Ferruginous Hawk day typically falls on September 27th, so we are hoping to have a far better than average year for this species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Volunteers were entertained as they shot from the West quadrant across the walkway, giving everyone a great view on their way into the city. Highlights of the day included a photo-shoot of a juvenile Ferruginous hawk, close passes by a Merlin, and an adrenaline-filled pursuit by a juvenile Northern Harrier by the banders at Hawk Blind. (The banders didn't get this one, but Hawkwatch got a great show!) Stray Broad-winged Hawks continued their southern migration, mixing into large kettles with Red-tailed Hawks and Red-shouldered Hawks for some Buteo identification practice. All in all a fun and busy blustery day! &lt;br/&gt;

The total number of raptors dropped from &gt;1000 to ~700.  Despite the decreased number of hawks we still had great looks at a few Ferruginous Hawks and a fair number of Broad-winged Hawks.

The hawks were flying fast and furious today up on the Hill.  The weather, for a change, was neither scorching nor freezing.  As the Hawkwatchers crested the platform in the morning, kettles of Broad-winged Hawks began rising from multiple directions, inciting a mad scramble to set up scopes, get on binos, and assemble in quadrants.  Both Accipiters were flying en masse, providing good identification practice for all. The quadrant system communication relays were tested as hawks flew every which way, including beautiful overhead views of a Merlin, adult and juvenile Broad-winged Hawks, a juvenile Peregrine Falcon, and many Red-shouldered Hawks. We also had a lovely, long look at a Prairie Falcon. But nothing could beat the luxurious flight of a Ferruginous Hawk (flashing its famed &#147;three points of light&#148; in the near-ideal viewing conditions) who, having enthralled the entire Hawkwatch, conjured a partner. Both of them flew onwards towards the Golden Gate, the Hawkwatch looking on in awe. Many thanks to the helpful guests who joined the team to keep our tally up to speed; we're happy to report that the data sheet looks the worse for wear!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NUTTY NUMBERS: Today was the third highest one-day count in GGRO's history, after September 25, 1999 (1,283 sightings; 206 HPH) and September 21, 1984 (2,833 sightings; 404 HPH)!&lt;br/&gt;

Though we didn't see many birds today, we saw a glorious whale.  While yesterday's heat drove in great diversity of species, today's cold and windy weather seemed to discourage raptors from flying. Some individuals braved the harsh conditions and were blown in circuits around the hill giving all quadrants a look. The few birds we had allowed Hawkwatchers to practice passing off raptors from one quadrant to the next and hone their identification skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whale, we are going to blow your mind with this cool whale fact:&lt;br/&gt;In 2011, Varvara, a Gray Whale, swam 14,000 miles from Russian to Mexico and broke the record for the longest mammalian migration.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To read more about Varvara, check out this link: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/150414-gray-whale-pacific-migration-endangered-ocean-animal-science/&lt;br/&gt;

Notable birds included two close-flying Ferruginous Hawks, a Golden Eagle, and almost 20 Broad-winged Hawks. Continuing the trend of the last week, Accipiter numbers remained high, and the greatest challenge of the day for newer Hawkwatchers was differentiating between Cooper's Hawks and Sharp-shinned Hawks. Non-raptor sightings included 487 Vaux's Swifts and 8 fighter jets performing aerial stunts over the Headlands. The great number and variety of raptors seen today made braving the high temperatures worth it, and Hawkwatchers were rewarded with a cool breeze at the end of the day. &lt;br/&gt;

Also flying in the sky were flurries of dragonflies and butterflies. Sadly, they didn't lure a Merlin into our viewshed.

Numbers of Sharp-shinned Hawks overcame those of Cooper's Hawks, though our two Accipiters are still neck-and-neck for the season. We saw a high number of Red-shouldered Hawks&#150;including two adults&#150;likely because of the still, warm conditions. Hawk watchers were ecstatic to see eight Broad-winged Hawks, two Ferruginous Hawks, and the first Swainson's Hawk of the season all in one day! With numbers like these, we're looking forward to more peak days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SWAINSON'S SECRET: Though we only see an average of six Swainson's Hawks per year at the GGRO, they are far more plentiful in flooded agricultural fields around Davis, CA, just an hour and a half's drive inland (depending on traffic!). But don't wait long to check &#145;em out&#150;they're headed to Argentina for the winter!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Nevertheless, our slow start failed to discourage us thanks to the cheering presence of dayleader Josh Haiman's new Siberian Husky puppy, Helena (so much CUTE!). Our Accipiter numbers have been building: today we saw 48 Sharp-shinned Hawks and 49 Cooper's Hawks. Other highlights of the day included the first eagle of the season, a juvenile Golden Eagle, which graced us with its presence in the final minutes of the count (it appeared on the scene over the FM towers at approximately 3:25 pm)! Below the Golden Eagle, Josh spotted the only Broad-winged of the day, making for an exciting end to the afternoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WING WITTICISM: Did you know that both airplane wings and boat sails are modeled after bird wings? The curve of the wing creates differential pressure above and below the wing (or sail), creating lift or forward movement. We enjoyed watching this principle come to life in the form of an intense regatta playing out below Hawk Hill.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Luckily, spirits were lifted shortly before this early end by a pair of whales displaying just west of the Golden Gate. Everyone got a look at the tail slapping in their scopes and binoculars, and whale-savvy Hawkwatchers determined them to be a mother and calf humpback whale pair. Despite the rain, the Wednesday 1 team left the hill with high spirits and plenty of practice differentiating Sharp-shinned Hawks from Cooper's Hawks.&lt;br/&gt;

We had a great time spotting many non-raptor species and three river otters in the Rodeo Valley Lagoon while waiting for the fog to clear. Ever hopeful, we hiked up to the Hill at noon and had a wonderful hour and a half of Hawkwatch and Outreach programs before being enveloped in the fog again. Even for such a short observation time, numbers of Sharp-shinned Hawks seem to finally be increasing! A juvenile Northern Harrier also gave us and the Hawk Talk participants an amazing view of both the signature white rump patch and pumpkin orange breast before flapping away into the fog.

However, howling winds and thickening fog forced us to retreat to the valley floor, where we were treated to the sight of an American Kestrel and a Great Horned Owl. Despite the inability to see any raptors on Hawk Hill, a mini Hawk Talk was enjoyed by a few brave, shivering participants at the base of the Hill. Come mid-afternoon, the winds at the top were still strong enough to blow away small children  and the visibility was down to ten feet, so the Saturday II team decided to call it a day and try again in a fortnight. We look forward to a clear and busy peak day in the near future!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

However, Hawkwatchers soon shed their many layers as the fog burned off. Raptor activity and weather up on the hill today were moderate; the wind kept the heat off of our diligent Hawkwatchers but didn't blow us off the hill, and the raptors kept us entertained but didn't overwhelm us. The highlights of the day included an early morning Merlin zooming through the fog, pausing only to catch an insect midair, as well as a few Northern Harriers giving us some prime examples of their unique silhouette and flight pattern. Overall, it was a pleasant day for the Friday II Hawkwatch, and we look forward to returning in two weeks for the migration peak!&lt;br/&gt;

Thankfully, around midday a breeze picked up, cooling off the hill and the raptors started to appear.  Notable sightings included a female American Kestrel, a few Osprey, and a female Northern Harrier.  As the wind picked up in the afternoon the team was treated to a stilling color banded Red-tailed Hawk hanging out between the West and North quadrants.

Early morning highlights included Osprey, some Cooper's Hawks, and a couple of Sharp-shinned Hawks. Visitors to Hawk Hill this week should be prepared for high temperatures with lots of ice water, hats, and a source of shade, and should consider an early morning trip instead of an afternoon one. &lt;br/&gt;

Even the Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks vacated the hill as temperatures climbed into the mid-nineties with no wind for relief. The "5th Quadrant" (the sky directly above the site) was especially busy today with many birds taking advantage of the thermals available. This gave Hawkwatchers good practice in distinguishing individuals in a kettle of different raptor species. Although warm weather is expected for the rest of the week, both Hawkwatchers and hawks are hoping for some cool winds in the coming days! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Hawkwatchers were cautious of overheating; lots of sunscreen and water were applied.  A squawk from the banders over the radio alerted those on the hill to the presence of a Broad-winged Hawk, the first of the season, flying high in the sky.   The call was seconded as High-Visibility Herb, recognized by his bright bike attire, summited the platform.  However, after the Broad-winged Hawk, raptor activity began to dwindle.  Turkey Vulture numbers continued to climb steadily throughout the day and there was a flurry of accipiter activity in the final hour.  &lt;br/&gt;

It was also the best day so far for total number of raptors counted, with a slightly higher total than yesterday's count. Highlights of the day included a beautiful overhead view of a Northern Harrier, an uptick in Cooper's Hawks, and a very cooperative Merlin who gave our newcomers a lingering look! In non-raptor news, three rare black swifts made a rare appearance above the south platform; we added three species each of butterflies and dragonflies to our bug sheet; and we were excited to witness a praying mantis pass us by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOLY HARRIER! Harriers are one of the few species we see on the Hill for which we distinguish adult males, adult females, and juveniles. Juveniles have a famously orange breast, typically described as "pumpkin" in tone. Females are comparatively streaky in the breast, which is unusual for an adult raptor (usually, juveniles are "streaky," while adults are "barred"). Males wear the nickname "The Grey Ghost" for their pale undersides, light grey wings, ghostly grey head, and supernatural yellow eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Over the course of the day, we saw nine different species and 356 individuals with 59.3 hawks per hour.  Even when the hawks were not present, it was lovely to be on the hill with mellow winds and clear skies all day. With sightings of juvenile and adult Peregrine Falcons, apprentices and interns had a great opportunity to compare the different plumages. Other highlights included a Northern Harrier in the last five seconds of Hawkwatch and an Osprey with very conspicuous molt. &lt;br/&gt;

The more unusual species were scattered throughout the day to keep us on our toes, starting with three morning Osprey who got the day off to a bright start. We caught great views of a Prairie Falcon, who obliged us by flying almost directly overhead before peeling away towards San Francisco. Two raptor identification study birds sent to us by Hawk Blind gave us a chance to sharpen our Accipiter identification skills, and a late-showing White-tailed Kite, called excitedly in by the west quadrant, left us feeling satisfied with our tenth species of the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARCHAIC ENGLISH FACT: We misspelled "bird" today and learned something new--according to the University of Michigan's Middle English dictionary, "brid" (also "brede," "berd," "burd," and "bord") is Middle English for the young of a bird.

Although we had a relatively slow hourly sighting rate, we did have some interesting raptors, including an adult Red-shouldered Hawk and a juvenile Northern Harrier, before being pushed off the hill by fog at 1:00. Spirits were high even though the fog was low, and Wednesday 1 looks forward to clear skies in the future. &lt;br/&gt;

However, Tuesday 1 observed a variety of raptor species spread throughout the day, including an Osprey, an American Kestrel, and a Peregrine Falcon. Hawk Hill frequent fliers (Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures) were also present. Although today was relatively slow in terms of raptor activity, the hawk watchers had a reason to celebrate: Allen Fish, GGRO's beloved director, celebrated his 30th anniversary with the program today! Treats were provided and the volunteers got to hear Allen's favorite memories since he started working here in 1985. Congratulations, Allen!&lt;br/&gt;

The first few hours, Hawkwatchers felt stuck in the doldrums, and the interns in the west quadrant counted only three Turkey Vultures in a whole hour. The day became more exciting  when &#147;Ouch!&#148;, a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk recently outfitted with a GSM transmitter, appeared in the north quadrant and gave us a good look at her transmitter. San Franciscans, look out for Ouch! travelling over the city. A little while later, Hawkwatchers spotted an interesting Turkey Vulture that had white marks on its shoulders rather than a solid black back. Things started to heat up in the one o'clock hour, as new species besides our usual customers began to appear. The stars of the show were a beautiful juvenile Ferruginous Hawk and a Prairie Falcon that flew past us from Hill 88. These sightings were the first of the season for these two species! Other species of note were a White-tailed Kite, Red-shouldered Hawk, Northern Harrier, and multiple Sharp-shinned Hawks and American Kestrels. After spotting the leucistic Red-tailed Hawk last cycle, it seems like Monday I is continuing our streak of spotting awesome raptors!&lt;br/&gt;

The wonderful weather and views brought many visitors to the hill who were quite curious and enthused to learn what we were looking at and yelling about. Today, we spotted many of our signature Turkey Vultures and juvenile Red-tailed Hawks, with a noticeable abundance of adult Red-tailed Hawks. To spice things up in the late afternoon, a handful of Cooper's Hawks, Ospreys, and a singular adult Red-shouldered Hawk blew by the hill. Overall, it was a good first day for the Sunday 2 team, and we look forward to seeing many more species on the hill as the migration season continues!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HAWK FACT: Californian Red-shouldered Hawks were previously called Red-bellied Hawks due to their vibrant orange chest and belly. These hawks are most often found in oak woodlands and near rivers, but are also common in urban areas where eucalyptus groves are present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

This early action was followed by some good Accipiter practice for the team as we had a good fly-by by a juvenile Cooper's Hawk. The weather stayed hot until the breeze picked up and began to blow the fog in as we left the hill, and we were treated to the sight of a wedding taking place over Kirby Cove!

Actually, it was the exact opposite: the brightest, sunniest day we've had on Hawk Hill so far. The clear day allowed us to spot a bounty of raptors, and by the end of the day we totaled 9 different species.  Hawkwatchers were excited to spot the first Merlin of the year far off over the Golden Gate Bridge, identified in a spotting scope. It was a good day for watching Northern Harriers, as four individuals offered great views of their white rump patches and brilliant orange juvenile plumages. The day also stood out in the number of American Kestrels seen, often in male-female pairs. The quadrant system worked especially effectively today when a number of individual raptors flew around the entire hill and each quadrant passed the bird on to the next. Thursday II looks forward to continuing this great teamwork and counting many more raptors this season!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LITERARY FUN FACT: In T.H. White's novel The Once and Future King, the wizard Merlin turns a young King Arthur into a Merlin to learn lessons from the hawks in the castle's mews. A second fun fact: T.H. White himself experimented with falconry and wrote a book about his experience titled The Goshawk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Although only four species of raptors were seen, there were many highlights.  A few dark morph Red-tailed Hawks were seen; allowing our hawkwatchers to get some good long looks in as the circled the hill.  An adult Peregrine Falcon put on a show in front of the Golden Gate Bridge, stooping multiple times on a juvenile Red-Tailed Hawk.  And a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk required a double take as it had a few adult central tail feathers.  &lt;br/&gt;

The good weather brought some great sightings of seven different species of raptors. We completed three different ID studies and the last bird, a Red-tailed Hawk, gave us an excellent view. After its release, it decided to perch on the rock right in front of the north quadrant (we were even able to read part of its color band). The new apprentices were blessed with excellent sightings of two Osprey, a juvenile and an adult Peregrine Falcon, and a Red-shouldered Hawk. Towards the end of the day, the wind and fog began to roll in along with a pack of six Turkey Vultures, one of which was packing a rotten lunch. After holding on tight to this hunk of meat for several minutes, its prize was snatched away by a sneaky Raven. This dramatic exchange wrapped up a lovely day on the hill. &lt;br/&gt;

The great conditions brought in a bounty of raptor species. Along with the usual Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and Cooper's Hawks, we spotted Osprey, White-tailed Kites, Northern Harriers, American Kestrels, and a Red-shouldered Hawk for a grand total of eight species. This team also enthusiastically counted butterflies and dragonflies, and was able to identify 8 different species, including a few not included on our insect count form. On a team half-filled with first-year apprentice Hawkwatchers, returning members enjoyed training these newer volunteers. Monday II looks forward to an awesome season of Hawkwatching! &lt;br/&gt;

The day did not look promising for Hawk Watch. After a fun meeting, we decided to wait and see if the fog would dissipate. While stalling, we took a stroll up the Miwok Trail into Gerbode Valley in search of some birds. We spotted two Red-tailed Hawks, a Great Blue Heron, and a few passerines. At 1:00pm, we looked up to Hawk Hill for signs of clearing fog, but it remained immersed.  Sadly, no count was completed today.

Apprentices and interns were teamed up with veteran Hawkwatchers and everyone got to work in their quadrants.  It was cloudy, but warm, and the birds were flying.  Some highlights included a fast flying falcon that was kind enough to circle around for a positive ID as a male American Kestrel and a last minute accipiter that turned out to be a juvenile Cooper's Hawk.

After arriving to a hill full of fog, pockets slowly started to open up after 11:30am. Many juvenile Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures flew through the skies, allowing the new apprentices and interns to practice identifying some of our site&#146;s most common raptors. The monotony of continuous Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks was broken by sightings of two beautiful American Kestrels, male and female, and five accipiters which challenged the ID skills of all on the hill. Then off in the distant fog, a group of juvenile Red-tailed Hawks soared over the southern hillside, but one bird was not like the others. The pale, white color of the bird was initially explained by the poor visibility in the southern quadrant. However, as the bird traveled into the clearer east quadrant, volunteers realized it was a partially leucistic Red-tailed Hawk! This individual had a completely white upper side, while the underside displayed typical juvenile plumage. Hawkwatchers were flush with excitement upon viewing this rare individual in flight. Though much of the day was foggy and windy, this incredible bird was the perfect kick-off to Hawkwatch. Perhaps this bird was an auspicious sign of a unique 2015 season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTERDISCIPLINARY FUN FACT: In ancient Roman times, priests interpreted the flight of birds to determine the favor of the gods, a practice known as Augury. The eagle was a symbol of Zeus, king of the gods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
