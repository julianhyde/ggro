Conditions around the office seemed to be improving around 11:30, so we took an optimistic drive up to the Annex. Unfortunately, the fog near the Hill did not clear, and we were forced to call the day early. However, the uncooperative weather did not keep our team from getting some good looks at juvenile Cooper's Hawks, a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk, and even an Osprey! We remain hopeful for sunnier Hawkwatch days in the future. &lt;br/&gt;

This season, Hawkwatch is thrilled to have so many wonderful volunteers returning and proud to be joined by 28 new apprentices. &lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the season started with a fogged-out day. However, the Monday 1 team managed to make the best of it by taking a Raptor ID quiz and watching flight videos. These educational moments were designed to help train new Hawkwatchers as well as to refresh raptor identification to everyone in the program. The team put their skills to the test, identifying a Red-tailed Hawk and Turkey Vultures down by the Lagoon later in the morning.&lt;br/&gt;Overall, it's exciting to have everyone back for the fall migration. Best of luck to the rest of the teams this week!&lt;br/&gt;
