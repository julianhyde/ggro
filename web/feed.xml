At the time, with good winds and lifting fog, all seemed like a promising day for migration. Sadly, less than an hour later, our familiar companion, The Fog, returned to the Headlands and swallowed our chances of seeing any more birds. With visibility worsening by the minute, we officially suspended our count early, and are hoping for better Tuesday 1's (and other days) in the future. (A quick disclaimer &#150; though we had a great 40 minutes counting hawks today, the short timing of our count means that our reported Raptors per Hour for the day is quite high&#133;)&lt;br/&gt;

A bunch of Broad-winged Hawks, including a few late afternoon adults, were early visitors to Hawk Hill. The Broad-wings were often joined by Red-shouldered Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, and Northern Harriers, forming large kettles in front of the Golden Gate Bridge and Slacker Ridge. In addition to Buteos, the Hawkwatchers were frequently following falcons &#150; American Kestrels, Merlins, and a mid-morning Peregrine to be exact. The migrating Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks continued to make appearances throughout the day (including an adult or two). Turkey Vultures and an Osprey capped the species count at 11. What started as a beautiful, sunny day ended at 3pm when the fog rolled back in.&lt;br/&gt;

Though we didn't have high hopes this morning looking at all of the fog, conditions improved throughout the day and we wound up recording our greatest number of raptors yet this season (with an average of over 115 raptors per hour!). In addition to the many Accipiters we saw in flight today we were fortunate to see many Broad-winged Hawks from the Hill, including some adults, as well as a good number of Merlins and our first Bald Eagle of the season! Hoping that the skies stay clear for future Hawkwatch teams. &lt;br/&gt;

During our hike around the lagoon and nearby trails, we saw 7 species of raptors. Osprey, Northern Harriers, American Kestrels, and Turkey Vultures all made appearances. We also saw Red-tails and Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks hunting in the fields. Hopefully the fog lifts soon and the team can get back to proper hawk counting next time!&lt;br/&gt;

Fog loomed over the ocean, but we continued counting raptors and watching Sharp-shinned Hawks dart about in the wind until it suddenly swept over the entire hill and left us with no visibility. We packed up our spotting scopes and binoculars and retreated down to Conzelman Road to attempt to wait out the fog, and yet it did not lift. Although we had to leave the hill early, we were able to get in one productive hour. Hopefully the gloomy weather will clear for tomorrow's team!&lt;br/&gt;

There were close ups of both adult and juvenile Ferruginous Hawks, plenty of Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks, and kettles of Turkey Vultures, Red-shouldered Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, and Broad-winged Hawks. At noon, we got a fantastic look at an adult Golden Eagle flying right below the hill! Despite the heat, Hawkwatch had a great full day on the hill. &lt;br/&gt;

Mid-afternoon, a adult Ferruginous Hawk appeared amongst a group of Red-tails before flying towards the Golden Gate Bridge. A late in the day Golden Eagle made a quick appearance before disappearing behind the hill, unseen thereafter. A wonderful, sunny 14-species day!&lt;br/&gt;

Before leaving, the Hawkwatch team encountered a crowd of enthusiastic birders by Rodeo Lagoon. These birders pointed out the exact location of an Eastern Yellow Wagtail, which appeared in the distance a few minutes after the team arrived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E-bird report of Eastern Yellow Wagtail (by William Legge): https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S48573259&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Though at times it seemed as if the fog would win, we had mostly clear skies throughout the day and were able to spot Red-tailed Hawks, Red-shouldered Hawks, and lots of Accipiters. Our patience with the fog was rewarded with two late afternoon Ferruginous Hawks, with one coming especially close to the Hill. The day wrapped up with some adult Red-tails hunting directly over us, making us feel less like the Hawkwatchers and more like the Hawkwatch-ees! It was great to finally get up on the Hill with Sunday 1 for the best day yet of the season. &lt;br/&gt;

The team was still able to get some good looks at Red-tailed, Sharp-shinned, and Cooper's Hawks, with some flying right over the hill in front of us. There was also a great sighting of a Merlin that flew low overhead before disappearing into the clouds. Later in the day, we had a clear view of some Broad-winged Hawks and an Osprey over the water. A Humpback Whale was also seen from the hill, and the team had fun watching it smack the water with its fluke before diving down and swimming away. &lt;br/&gt;

As we left the hill, a juvenile Sharp-shinned flew low over all our heads and gave us a great look at it, almost as if it were saying goodbye. Until next time, sweet sharpies!&lt;br/&gt;

The count began with many of our often-seen species like Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures. However, as the day continued, we began to see more diversity and greater numbers. Sharp-shinned Hawks and Cooper's Hawks rode along the Slacker ridgeline from noon onwards. A sub-adult Golden Eagle flew around Hawk Hill toward San Francisco, giving the team time to look at feather molt and determine the age of the bird. Northern Harriers flew in rocking dihedrals down in the valleys around the counting platforms. By the end of the day, the team had also welcomed three new species to this seasons' count: a distant dark morph Swainson's Hawk, a fast-moving Merlin, and a soaring adult Ferruginous Hawk. &lt;br/&gt;

We also were lucky enough to see a Red-shouldered Hawk at today's Raptor Release (which accompany the noon Hawk Talks every weekend in September and October!). We also got to witness the launching of System 001 with The Ocean Cleanup Project, passing under the bridge and past Hawk Hill on its way to start cleaning up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

Despite this continued adversity, we birded around the Headlands in the hope that the fog would later lift (sadly, it did not). We did see a few Townsend's Warblers to brighten our day, however, and got some looks at intermediate- and dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks as well. Hoping the fog comes to an end soon, since we want to see more raptors - as well as our shadows. &lt;br/&gt;

We got a good look at a far away Peregrine Juvenile interacting with a Red-tailed juvenile, which made for great discussion and comparison. Thanks to some keen eyes we spotted two Kestrels in the last half hour of the day, as well as a tagged Turkey Vulture, whose number we were unable to read.

The hill was clear this morning, so we all hustled into our cars to start hawkwatching as quickly as we could. The fog came in and out intermittently in the morning with few birds in the sky, but as the day went on it stayed clear for us and we started seeing some cool birds. Multiple groups of Rough-winged Swallows and Band-tailed Pigeons flew by the hill, and we saw harbor porpoises and a humpback whale spouting in front of the bridge. We saw five raptor species in total, with one juvenile Cooper's Hawk that showed up in the last five minutes of the day making the only Accipiter of the day. We're all looking forward to reconvening on the hill in September.&lt;br/&gt;

Hopefully, next week will bring clearer weather and additional interesting birds to see!&lt;br/&gt;

However, the group still had a good time birding around the nearby lagoon, seeing seabirds such as Brown Pelicans, Double-crested Cormorants, and Western Gulls. We also spotted some Blue-gray Gnatcatchers and a Cedar Waxwing in the nearby bushes! Later, we moved over to a mowed field and got some great views of foraging passerines such as House Finches, Western Bluebirds, White-crowned Sparrows, and Spotted Towhees. There was also a great moment where we saw an American Kestrel angrily dive at a Red-tailed Hawk that was hanging out in a tree. Despite the poor weather conditions that prevented us from getting up the hill, Sunday 1 still had a fun morning birding!&lt;br/&gt;

The morning started off well; minutes after we got settled in our quadrants an Osprey appeared straight overhead. We continued having a steady stream of sightings throughout the day, with a handful of juvenile Red-tailed Hawks every hour plus others. We even caught sight of a Turkey Vulture that was tagged for our Project Zopilote! The vulture appeared a few times right below us and even though the bright blue patagial tags are large with three printed numbers, we all struggled to get a good view of the number. However, passing the tagged vulture between quadrants was a great team-building experience for us and added some excitement to our pre-peak day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We would definitely recommend other Hawkwatchers who have cameras with good zoom capability to bring them out, not only to take pictures of the beautiful migrants we see, but also to take pictures of tagged vultures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

We were lucky to have seen Peregrine Falcons, Northern Harrier and a small group of Purple Martins while on the Hill. Our team got a lot of practice identifying Red-tailed Hawks as many decided to hover overhead for long periods of time. An adult Accipiter flew overhead, helping to shake off the off-season rust of having to differentiate Cooper's Hawks from Sharp-shinned Hawks. In the end it was an adult Cooper's Hawk. A great first day on Hawk Hill, and an excited look to what the season will bring!&lt;br/&gt;

Unfortunately, the fog near the Hill did not clear, and we were forced to call the day early. However, the uncooperative weather did not keep our team from getting some good looks at juvenile Cooper's Hawks, a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk, and even an Osprey!

This season, Hawkwatch is thrilled to have so many wonderful volunteers returning and proud to be joined by 28 new apprentices. &lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the season started with a fogged-out day. However, the Monday 1 team managed to make the best of it by taking a Raptor ID quiz and watching flight videos. These educational moments were designed to help train new Hawkwatchers as well as to refresh raptor identification to everyone in the program. The team put their skills to the test, identifying a Red-tailed Hawk and Turkey Vultures down by the Lagoon later in the morning.&lt;br/&gt;Overall, it's exciting to have everyone back for the fall migration. Best of luck to the rest of the teams this week!&lt;br/&gt;
