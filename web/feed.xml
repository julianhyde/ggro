It was a calm morning with a gentle wind from the NE that varied throughout the day, only reaching 8-mph gusts by the end of the day. Though clouds began to creep in after noon, for the most part, the temps lingered in the mid to upper 50's F.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again a pair of adult Peregrine Falcons welcomed our team at the top of Hawk Hill this morning. Many wispy cirrus clouds served as a backdrop as the Peregrines cut through the air, patrolling the area, and dutifully escorted any intruding Red-tailed Hawks out of the area. Luckily, a handful of adult and juvenile Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks avoided confrontations with the vociferous falcons. Another individual that dodged a pointed encounter was an adult Bald Eagle -probably because it was so far away, just below the peak of Tamalpais.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our day ended just as it began, with a Peregrine tormenting anything in sight. Perhaps only the setting sun, an hour earlier today thanks to daylight saving time, will be what gives the Redtails some respite from the persistent falcons!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Becky Olsen &amp; Ken Wilson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Paul Meadow, Maggie Montenegro, Ana Maria Olivar, Carol Weinstein, Allen Fish, Laura Echávez&lt;br/&gt;

The wind -- around 2-5 mph -- squirreled from the SW to the NW to the S, all of which is typical for a pre-storm day.  Or maybe this was an actual storm day. Twice in the mid-day there were actual drops of rain patting the data tablet, and a rainbow was visible in the northern landscape from 1030 am til at least 1 pm.  Temps ranged from 58 to 65.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The migration rate was 19 raptor-sightings per hour with about a 45% Vulture Index. High points for the day were: a circling adult Peregrine doing surveillance on the western hill for a good 20 mins; and two handfuls of Sharpshins like up-falling leaves, circling upward zooming past Hawk Hill, alulas expanded and coasting on the wind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Holly Thomas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Tomas McKay, Paulette Sherry, Will Ludan, Mitchell Green, Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

A cold, but gentle wind tip-toed from the south and circled the hill throughout the day as the temps lingered in the mid- to upper-50s. As the team walked up to the count site, a mother Humpback Whale and its calf meandered near the mouth of the Golden Gate, spouting and breaking the glassy surface of the San Francisco Bay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The morning consisted of the usual migrants, mainly Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures, though we had a sprinkle of Cooper's Hawks as well. After lunch time, more species began to make an appearance. Sharp-shinned Hawks, Northern Harriers, and Peregrine Falcons were all in the mix -even a White-tailed Kite that seemed to be flying over the Earth's stratosphere. Around 2pm, a couple of Buteos circled over Slacker Ridge, one was a Redtail and the other a mysterious dark morph. As the dark morph bird broke off, it banked south and straight for San Francisco. Optics flew to the hawkwatchers' eyes, and we realized it was not another Redtail, instead... the eagerly awaited Rough-legged Hawk! At the end of the day, a juvenile Swainson's Hawk flew east over Mount Tamalpais, capping off an amazing day for the team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Allen Fish &amp; Laura Echávez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Pat Contaxis, Michaela Figari, Jim Yampolsky, Pauline Yeckley&lt;br/&gt;

Our hawkwatchers were back on Hawk Hill, despite a brief 15-min rain at 11am. The magnificent storm clouds passed and made way for blue skies and a variety of clouds (cumulus, nimbus, and many wispies).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bird front was very quiet, but the storm brought us two Bald Eagles! The first arrived straight out of the north, slowly soaring as it made its way right over the team. As we watched it cross the Golden Gate, another adult materialized overhead and followed the same trajectory to the city.

The fog lingered for most of the day, creeping closer and closer at times, but we maintained enough visibility to continue counting. The sun did peak out from the fog for the last couple of hours and the fall lighting illuminated the birds flying against Slacker ridge in a beautiful, glowing way. One of those birds was a juvenile Northern Harrier, and the rusty or "pumpkin" color seemed to radiate as the bird quickly passed through and continued its journey south.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hawkwatch team was a bit slim today, a "skeleton" crew as one hawkwatcher put it, and most agreed that the highlight of the day was a slow moving and steady Bald Eagle. It was a bit challenging to distinguish between juvenile and sub-adult plumage in the hazy mist and unfavorable light conditions, but we genuinely enjoyed the sighting, nonetheless...  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Krista Fanucchi, GGRO Assistant Biotechnician &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Allen Fish &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Roy Pisetsky, Linda Schneider, Jan Ambrosini, Tim Stroshane, Krista Fanucchi &lt;br/&gt;

Visibility was out to Mount Diablo and the Farallon Islands for most of the time. The wind was slow to start and variable, eventually gusting southwest up to 13 mph. Temperatures stayed at just about 60 degrees F ending with very chilly conditions for the North and West. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The day was slow to start with a handful of Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks far along the ridgelines and hugging the hillside down to Kirby Cove. We eagerly awaited the wind as we admired a full circle fog bow glowing around the sun-soaked clouds. Peregrine Falcons effortlessly zoomed through the increasing winds as a puff of fog moved in from the ocean. One was diving on a Red-tailed Hawk and the other circled higher alongside a Cooper's Hawk. We wondered if it was being considered competition or prey.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a few scattered Cooper's Hawks and Sharp-shinned Hawks zipped through the Headlands, we hoped that the day would end with a surprise. Indeed it did! Our team in North Quadrant noticed an interesting buteo flapping in from the ridge with distinctly pointed wingtips. An adult Swainson's Hawk navigated the swaths of clouds and blue as we watched it fly off toward the Bay Bridge. With a theatrical bookend to the day's adventure, our team recounted our appreciation for each other and the birds that bring us together as the skyline glowed a brilliant orange before extinguishing the light with a frigid burst of fog to wrap up the count. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;-Carmen DeLeon, Conservation and Community Science Program Coordinator &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Holly Thomas &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Laura Thomas, Sonja Raub, Conner Cimmiyotti, Yvette MacDonald, Allen Fish, Carmen DeLeon &lt;br/&gt;

A cool 5-mph breeze graced the hillside, enough to provide birds with a little lift, but still keeping them at a comfortable just above eye-level flight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As we approached the count site, a familiar face sat along the south platform lookout and carefully eyed our approach. An adult Peregrine Falcon that has been a frequent visitor for a couple of weeks now! It lazily circled over the area, close enough to project its shadow on the diligent hawkwatchers. Around lunch time, a raptor that we don't often see during migration emerged and nimbly crossed the Mt. Tamalpais ridgeline -a White-tailed Kite. Barely an hour later, another special raptor was picked up by our guest counter, Raptor Biologist &amp; Banding Manager, Teresa Ely! A subadult Golden Eagle made a full tour around the Headlands and almost all the way across to downtown San Francisco. One Golden Gate crossing was not enough, however, as it turned around and headed back to the Headlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With just a little over a month left in the season, we could not ask for a better assortment of raptors for the Thursday hawkwatch team!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech &amp; Carmen DeLeon, CCS Program Coordinator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Christine Cariño&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Pat Bacchetti, Arden Bucklin-Sporer, Susan Greef, Teresa Ely, Carmen DeLeon, Laura Echávez&lt;br/&gt;

Birds were far beyond Mount Tam, low above the rifle range, high overhead, and beyond the Golden Gate. Today was a great day to practice some scope spotting skills, as many of the avian visitors were distant specks along the furthest ridge lines.

It was a brisk 58-degree morning with gentle 6-mph winds and azure-blue skies above -some would say ideal hot chocolate weather. The only missing component for a late-October day: raptors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first couple of hours were exciting, with handfuls of distant and high overhead Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and some Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks. At one point, a speck of a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk soared over the Upper Rodeo Trail, slowly spiraling towards Sausalito. As we watched this Redshoulder, another team member noticed another Redshoulder below it, an adult this time. Before we knew it, there were four of them in our field of view at once!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At noon, there was a noticeable decline in activity. The only highlight for the afternoon came at 12:30pm, when a lanky buteo appeared above the Marin Mammal Center. As it flashed its dark flight feathers, a definitive fieldmark for this Western species, we quickly identified it as a Swainson's Hawk. We had a five-buteo day last week, and with these later Swainies and even Broad-winged Hawks, the chances of a six-buteo day in the coming weeks are looking pretty good!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Becky Olsen &amp; Ken Wilson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Paul Meadow, Kinley Renger, Carol Weinstein, Allen Fish, Laura Echávez&lt;br/&gt;

We were dazzled with the clear visibility out to Mt. Diablo as we welcomed the start of a peaceful autumn day. A light haze floated atop the ocean and out toward Pacifica. The blue skyline was dappled in fluffy white clouds which were the perfect contrasting backdrop for spotting birds. Wind was highly variable in direction and barely noticeable at times with a steadier 3-5 mph breeze taking us into the early afternoon. Though we got some close looks, many raptors seemed to be taking the 5th quadrant (overhead) approach to crossing the hillside while others stayed far out on the ridgeline of Slacker Hill.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first bird of the day did not disappoint! Our teammates of South and West Quadrants kicked it off with a large dark bird that was initially picked up as a Turkey Vulture. As they noticed the steady flight and distinct bold contrast, they cheerily announced that it was actually an adult Bald Eagle making its way across the valley. Our whole team gazed into the blue sky getting excellent looks as it soared by. With our eyes primed for the eagle silhouette, we also sighted a juvenile Bald Eagle later on. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soon, the theme of the day became fast flapping falcons. Two adult Peregrine Falcons swooped in tight formation at a juvenile Peregrine in Kirby Cove letting it know that it had wandered too close. It was a morning filled with Peregrine acrobatics and the distinctive "kek kek kek" filled the air. We admired the dusty blue and rufous plumage of a male American Kestrel and noticed Merlins buzzing through the hillside. Several teammates followed a Merlin through the fifth quadrant and toward the span of the bridge as it faded into the distance over the East Bay.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, we were delighted with the wide open skies all day long and hope the conditions continue as we see what the migration brings tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Carmen DeLeon, Conservation &amp; Community Science Program Coordinator &amp; Krista Fanucchi, GGRO Biotech &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Jane Rudebusch &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Lora Roame, Michael Voeltz, Maryrose Kulick, Jennifer Miller, Mary Malec, Allen Fish, Krista Fanucchi, Carmen DeLeon &lt;br/&gt;

So we quickly abandoned Hawk Hill for Rodeo Valley, and joined up with 15+ people seeking a glimpse of the Willow Warbler that is starting day 4 of offering very cooperative looks for birders.  After a few glimpses of the warbler, and good looks at a Tropical Kingbird, we called it quits for the 1 pm fog-caused shutdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Holly Thomas, Horacio Mena&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Mitch Green, Connor Cimmiyotti, Tomas McKay, Will Ludan, Paulette Sherry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A side note on the Willow Warbler - this is a Eurasian warbler species that had not yet been documented in the lower 48 states until last Tues, October 18, when Rodeo Lagoon bird-monitor William Legge crossed paths with it next to the lagoon, popping around the Coyote Brush and Willows.  Several hundred birders have continued some surveillance of this vagrant songbird since Tuesday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a few days of being in a bit of shock, I want to pause here to honor the passing of Dr. Dave DeSante last Tuesday, in the small valley east of Rodeo Beach known as North Valley, while he was looking for the Willow Warbler with friends. Thought to have suffered a heart attack, Dave was quickly reached by emergency responders from both NPS and Marin Fire - but could not be revived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Dave DeSante was an internationally-known ornithologist from west Marin, one of a band of highly productive and influential conservation biologists at Point Reyes Bird Observatory (now Point Blue Conservation Science) in the 1970s-1990s, and the president and founder of the Institute for Bird Populations.  Dave was a huge influence on many of us in the conservation biology community through his creative intellectual approaches, his mentoring, and organizational talents. He moved the MAPS (Monitoring Avian Productivity) station concept from being a West Marin PRBO thing to being an invaluable tool for long-term monitoring songbird populations, which the USFS, NPS, and other government conservation agencies wholly embraced. He was a shaker-mover for Partners in Flight and the Western Bird Banding Association, where we sometimes crossed paths. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dave was on the first GGRO Scientific Advisory Committee in 1986, advising our NPS-Parks Conservancy team on how best to set up the counting and banding programs for maximum scientific impact. His own output of scientific articles, many of them ground-breaking and based on wide collaborations, was amazing. He was also an expert on (among many things) vagrancy in songbirds, and he advanced some interesting theories about off-course behaviors and migratory "traps" such as the Farallones and outer Point Reyes.  Check out the listing for Dave's scientific articles at Google Scholar. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, Dave DeSante was a kind and friendly person who treated colleagues with warmth and camaraderie, and although I didn't know him well, whenever our paths crossed, he always made me feel like a long-lost friend. Thank you, Dave - &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The fog had other plans. As we prepared to start the count, an inversion layer mantled the mouth of the San Francisco Bay, and the cooling 10-mph winds raced from the east. In the hours that followed, the winds shifted to the west, allowing the fog to creep closer and higher, giving us tantalizing views to the west and north until finally pouring over the entire Hill at 2pm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GGRO Hawkwatch, fun fact #2: Red-tailed Hawks always find the best thermals over Kirby Cove.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was quieter on the bird front today, and most kept their distance from the Hill. However, we enjoyed an hour of mostly adult Redtails riding the thermal elevator over Kirby Cove before dispersing in various directions -only to return to Kirby and do the same thing all over again. One of these adult Redtails was a beautiful dark morph Redtail! Another couple of birds that joined the elevator game were a handful of Broad-winged Hawks and several Red-shouldered Hawks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GGRO Hawkwatch, fun fact #3: We absolutely love what we do, and even after days when the raptors morphed into fog, we look forward to the next opportunity to see many more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Christine Carino &amp; Gretchen Zantzinger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Pat Contaxis, Michaela Figari, Jim Yampolsky, Pauline Yeckley, Laura Echávez&lt;br/&gt;

A low haze lingered in the distance early in the morning, but we could still see the North Farallon Islands to the west and Mt. Diablo to the east. By noon, the northeasterly wind was non-existent and the temps were already in the mid-80s. It was a balmy afternoon and the team had to pause the count for 30 minutes while we waited for the breeze to pick up -which it did, just a little, during the last hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lack of wind did not bring many raptors, but some of the ones passing through did give us some great looks! A few of the highlights include Merlins and Peregrine Falcons, and for both species we had some spectacular close-ups right over the team. We also observed a few more Broad-winged Hawks and eight Red-shouldered Hawks. One of the Redshoulders was a beautiful adult that circled under Slacker Ridge for a few minutes before joining a small kettle of Turkey Vultures, eventually breaking off towards San Francisco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Don Bartling &amp; Erica Harris&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: John Davis, Sue Morgan, Laura Echávez&lt;br/&gt;

A cold dry wind flexed from the NE from the start of the day with temps in the mid 70's eventually crawling up to 83-degrees by 1 pm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The raptor flight was great today - much of it coming at eye level on Hawk Hill, but with some birds on the higher flight line, now technically referenced as the Fanucchi Line, which refers to a flight line of raptors that materializes some 1000+-ft overhead (or more), and where raptors are mere shapes and wingflaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highlights today included a few more Broad-winged Hawk sightings to add to the already amazing 2022 total (545 sightings as of Oct 17) for this unusual species in our state. Also inspiring today to see 5 of the 6 possible Buteo species at the Golden Gate, -- Ferruginous and Swainson's being the special soaring hawks of the day.  Juvs of both species made close west-to-east passes in the afternoon.  Many adult accips around - but still small overall numbers of Coopers and Sharpshins for this season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A juvenile Bald Eagle made a 5-min circle over Rodeo Lagoon in the mid-day before cutting northward for better fishing perhaps.  Ten mins after closing the count at 3 pm, we picked up a juv Golden Eagle along Wolfback Ridge above Sausalito.  Although the latter wasn't included in the official count, it was great to know that young eagles pass over the Marin Headlands from time to time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-	Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Catherine Elliott, Mary Kenney&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Woody Woodbury, Maureen Grabowski, Tom Luster, Dennis Davison, Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

There was a slight eastern wind, which shifted to a west wind around noon.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When birds are seen above our heads we typically yell out "5th quadrant", tilt our heads up to the furthest extent, and cross our fingers for a cloud or speck to use as a reference point. Today we would have really benefitted from some lounge chairs, more spotting scopes, and a better look!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an exceptionally good chance that we spotted a Northern Goshawk today. The bird was first picked up in a scope just east of Hill 88, did a few fluid accipiter flaps before it tucked into a glide, journeyed far above our heads, and trailed off above San Francisco... Farewell! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We finished off the day with two Golden Eagles, an Osprey, and a handful of accipiters that kept appearing as we were packing up and heading off the hill. How are we supposed to walk away from all the excitement? Oh yes, the day must end at some point, and we get the chance to do it all again soon...

The team observed 32 hawks per hour, 160 individuals and 10 species total.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today challenged hawkwatchers to stay alert as birds were spotted low, far, high overhead, heading in all directions, and with little consistency on flight patterns or paths. We are still seeing some Broad-winged Hawks, two of which were dark morphs. The usual groups of Red-tailed Hawks, Red-shouldered Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and Accipiters were spotted between bursts of activity and flight from smaller flocks of passerines.

After unsuccessful attempts to find the vagrant Vermillion Flycatcher, we decided to take a look at the Hill -where the velvet white enveloped with permanence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While we continued to wait for the fog to lift, the Hawkwatch team ventured out to Battery Mendell. We explored the historic site and managed a few sightings of Peregrine Falcons zipping through the coastal air currents. Before facing the reality of no hawk count for today, we stopped at the overlook on the way to the Point Bonita Lighthouse, where harbor seals rested on the rocks.

Cautiously navigating the one way road, we paused often for rabbits and quail crossing. The fog seemed to lower in just the time it took to drive into the visitor center lot. Our team ventured off to look for a Vermilion Flycatcher recently spotted nearby, but we didn't see or hear it. We kept hiking onward to the Bobcat Trail and got a glimpse of two Great Horned Owls resting in the eucalyptus trees. Say's Phoebes hunted the hillsides and we watched a Red-tailed Hawk tuck and dive above. The screeches of Red-shouldered Hawks echoed from the trees above Rosenstock Road. As our stomachs started to call for lunchtime, we celebrated getting our steps in for the day and shuffled back to check for the flycatcher one more time before ending with a picnic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Let's hope for a strong gust to move this fog on through for brighter skies tomorrow! &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Carmen DeLeon, Conservation and Community Science Program Coordinator &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Libby Rouan and Holly Thomas &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Sonja Raub, Conner Cimmiyotti, Horacio Mena, Yvette MacDonald, Carmen DeLeon &lt;br/&gt;

However, the looming fog never completely enveloped the Hill, and the Hawkwatch team finally enjoyed a full day of counting birds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We were graced by the adult female Peregrine that has been perching along the South Platform as she patrolled the area, escorting many migrating raptors out of the area. Even the Merlins that flew past the counters today were traveling at speeds faster than their usual speed of light. Another exciting sighting was that of a juvenile Golden Eagle that rose from the large radio towers to the north, suddenly disappearing from view, only to re-materialize over Slacker Ridge. Less than an hour after, another young Golden flew over Hawk Hill! Despite the migration season being past what we call the "Accipiter peak," Sharpies and Coops are still passing through, more adults now than before.

An adult Peregrine perched on the corner of the South platform before swiftly taking off to pursue a flock of Band-tailed Pigeons. The only "sunshine" in sight today was the flash of feathers from a Yellow-shafted Flicker, a rare sighting up here on Hawk Hill. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hawkwatch crew eagerly counted down the last 20 minutes, as the fog thickened, and the winds increased around 2:45pm; grateful for the birds seen but also longing for warmth or a hot beverage.

Bluebirds, and assorted passerines. This morning also, the GGRO banding team got a look at the Tropical Kingbird (seen yesterday also) on the wires around Ft Cronkhite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enough fog backed off Hawk Hill that we started a regular count (with limited visibility) in the noon hour.  By 2 pm, the fog smothered the Hill again being pulled up the slope by 25-mph gusts from the west.  Some nice birds during the 75-minute count, including several gangs (2-3 birds) of Sharpshins and two Broad-winged Hawks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After closing the count, a few of us talked in the Hawk Hill parking lot and around 3 pm, were treated to a pair of adult Peregrines repeatedly contouring the south-facing slope of Hawk Hill possibly to scare up a WC Sparrow snack.  The falcon flybys were a lovely punctuation mark on a foggy-windy day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-	Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Andy Bradshaw, Mary Kenney&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Chris Tarr, Jody Newman, Rich Eliason, Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The team attempted a last look at the Hill during lunchtime as we sat in a circle on the Middle Platform. At 12:50pm, the winds picked up, howling and pushing thicker fog onto the platform, prompting our descent out of Hawk Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Becky Olsen &amp; Ken Wilson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Maggie Montenegro, Ana Maria Olivar, Kinley Renger, Carol Weinstein, Allen Fish, Laura Echávez&lt;br/&gt;

Thanks to Mark Dettling and Steve Howell for the heads-up.  We will keep a tight watch for the next few days.&lt;br/&gt;There are three previous records for autumn Mississippi Kites over the Marin Headlands: 1976, 2003, and 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lovely thin veneer of fog accented the Marin Headlands, the high buildings of SF, and the tippy-tops of the GGB towers this morning. A skink's breath of wind from the east, and the Broad-winged Hawks started up right away. The no-wind became west wind and grew through the day until it was gusting to 12 mph, and blowing the fog back in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the day, flocks formed and dispersed and reformed; they gathered into kettles, sliding into the bottom, and gliding off the top, and then re-assembled a mile away. Again and again. We tracked these carefully to avoid recounts as well as they could be tracked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often the Broadies co-flocked with Turkey Vultures, and these flocks gathered up a few accipiters, some Redshoulder, Redtails as well.  Fog came and went throughout the day, and engulfed the western slopes of the Hill by 3 pm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Late in the day, a flock of 23 Broad-winged Hawks coalesced into a tight whirl of birds, perhaps 30 feet wide and 100 feet tall, right over the Rifle Range, just west of Hawk Hill.  It was lit perfectly by late day sun, and was one of the most beautiful views I have ever had of birds anytime anywhere.  The flock turned and turned for about two mins then the bulk of the hawks streamed southward over Hawk Hill's western flanks and disappeared into the fog toward San Francisco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-	Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Horacio Mena, Holly Thomas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Connor Cimmiyotti, Will Ludan, Paulette Sherry, Mitch Green, Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

We had near full clearing in all directions in the mid-day, perhaps for an hour or 2, but the day was a kind of art gallery of fog with every fog-spill, blanket, mental-fog, pea-soup, wispyness, every fog variation you could imagine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winds were quiet in the morning but were blasting from the west after 1 pm - gusting up to 15 mph.  Temps stayed between 60 and 72 through the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The usual hawks showed up - Redtails, Cooper's, and Sharpshin, especially the latter, but the headliners were Broad-winged Hawks and Turkey Vultures. Most of the Broadies were working thermals in flocks of 10-20, with similar-sized vulture flocks also working sometimes mingled with the Broadies, sometimes in species-specific flocks.  These flocks provided thermal "markers" for other raptors as well, so Sharpshins and Coops and small falcons would jump in, ride the elevator up and then peel off to the south.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond getting a daily count, this was just a beautiful day for watching the dynamics of flocking raptors and micro-weather patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-	Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Gretchen Zantzinger, Christine Carino&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Bob Blumberg, Pauline Yeckley, Patricia Contaxis, Michaela Figari, Carmen DeLeon, Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The visibility was bipolar, with 0.2 mile visibility to the west, and Mt Diablo visible (32.2 mils) to the east.  The fog retreated gradually in the first hour revealing most of the eastern and northern ridges and the SF skyline, and ... oh yeah...&lt;br/&gt;a few Broad-winged Hawks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as the fog lifted there were Broadies underneath.  First there were six, then there were 16, a bit later, 24.  We spent the afternoon acting as Broad-winged Hawk traffic monitors.  How many in your kettle?  Any adults or dark morphs? Is the column moving left or right?  Look, three Broadies just peeled off the top to join those Redtails.  Watch for Sharpies in-between the Broadies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like with Turkey Vultures, accipiters seem to use Broadwing flocks as markers to gauge where lift is happening.  Thermals, updrafts - it's all good.  Fun especially to watch a tiny male Sharpshin soar speedily upward among a dozen Broadwings.  I know the eastern hawkwatchers see this all the time, but in California, most of our Broadwings are singles, so when we finally get a group together, the flock-flying behaviors are downright mesmerizing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lots of Sharpshins today as well, including a few adults - fun to see the gray backs in bright sun.  A few other singles of different species, but this was a Broadwing and Accipiter Day to be sure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, yes, except for the Palm Warbler - which landed among the Baccharis bushes on the summit of Hawk Hill in the mid afternoon and spent a few hours popping from shrub to ground to shrub, tilting its long tail and nibbling bugs.

The flight started to pick up as we were wrapping up our morning meeting, and we got a couple of close looks at Broad-winged Hawks as they passed overhead and lifted in the breeze.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many birds were spotted as they quickly rose above Rodeo Lagoon, climbed into the 5th quadrant, and drifted out towards the Presidio. Head on, a Ferruginous Hawk, holding its wings raised in a dihedral, flew towards Hawk Hill and soared above our heads and in the direction of the Golden Gate. This sighting was a highlight for many hawkwatchers at the end of the day, though our heads were left spinning from all the exciting 5th quadrant activity. Lots of Peregrine Falcons too! I am convinced; birds are cool, migration is captivating, and we are so lucky to be observers.        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Krista Fanucchi, GGRO Assistant Biotechnician &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: James McDermott &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Linda Schneider, Deborah Crooks, Roy Pisetsky, Jan Ambrosini, Kimberlie Moutoux, Krista Fanucchi &lt;br/&gt;

Most of the flight was way up in the 5th quadrant (straight up), tiny specks passing through small clouds and fading in and out of the blue. Hawkwatchers were left spinning as they spotted birds in the north, followed the flight overhead, and quickly turned to watch the bird trail off towards the Golden Gate Bridge and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Broad-winged, Red-shouldered Hawks, a couple of Northern Harriers, and many Accipiters kept us on our toes, as we scanned and sometimes strained for a better look; thankful for the few wispy clouds overhead that could be used as reference points while describing location, instead of just yelling "bird overhead, straight up, right there!"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although, at times, that is the best we can do.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;-Krista Fanucchi, GGRO Assistant Biotechnician &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Sam Hontalas &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Laura Coatney, Melissa Kohner, Rod Santos, Courtney Buechert, Ryan Overhiser, Krista Fanucchi, Allen Fish &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

We had a fair share of raptor sightings as well! We heard a pair of adult Redtails over the Marine Mammal Center as they rose in a tight circle, feet down, in a sweet courtship display. A male Kestrel hovered right over us, likely foraging for some imperceptible rodent or camouflaged grasshopper. Though we never made it to Hawk Hill, we had a lovely end to the walk as a member of the team spotted a pair of sleeping Great-horned Owls just below the canopy of eucalyptus trees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Mary Malec &amp; Brian O'Laughlin &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Alex Cox, Rasia Holzman Smith, JJ Harris, Carmen DeLeon, Laura Echávez&lt;br/&gt;

Wind was nowhere to be found and it was a warm morning with the day ranging from 70-74 degrees F. With a slow start to the raptor flow, we enjoyed a good look at an adult male Northern Harrier- the infamous "grey ghost." Though the birds were slow at first, we were happy to see the first group of the season of Migratory Story students enjoying the lower viewpoints of Hawk Hill. We love welcoming our future raptor biologists! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ever so slight 2 mph breeze started the migration flow. Kestrels danced through the sky up the cables of the Golden Gate Bridge and our midday excitement included watching Osprey glide across the valley and the lagoon. We hoped that the Broad-winged Hawk kettles from yesterday would continue, and indeed they did! Several kettles drifted in from Mount Tam as we patiently waited for them to get closer. We marveled at their flight pattern of small circling groups that reminded us of a mobile of birds on invisible strings. It was wonderful to see kettles of 5 or so birds being joined by Turkey Vultures, accipiters, and Red-tailed Hawks as the floated over Slacker Ridge toward the bay. A distant Golden Eagle was spotted in the northwest, and though we kept hoping it would come closer, it continued onward into the greenery toward Tam. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the last hour of the day, foghorns bellowed as thick fog blanketed the southeast and started to cover the lagoon in the west. A strong breeze of 10-12 mph from the west brought a flurry of Sharp-shinned Hawks near and far as the counters were tallying right up to the last minute busy with birds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carmen DeLeon, Conservation &amp; Community Science Program Coordinator &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Holly Thomas &amp; Libby Rouan &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Laura Thomas, Sonja Raub, Connor Cimmiyotti, Horacio Mena, Allen Fish, Carmen DeLeon &lt;br/&gt;

The gusts picked up during the last hour, reaching up to 9-mph, but with birds blasting over the Hill all day long, it was evident the wind was not needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the day was kettles of mostly Broadwings with a mix of Redtails, Coops, and Sharpies that rose over Slacker Ridge and slowly drifted towards the Golden Gate Bridge. The first Broadwing kettle of the morning emerged when the Hawkwatch team was getting ready to start the count! After that, we eagerly anticipated an exciting day -and the raptors delivered! The morning's highlights include a fleeting look at a White-tailed Kite and a few Merlins, one of which was snacking on a winged arthropod in flight. Noon had its own set of excitement; a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk rose from Gerbode Valley and made straight for the Bridge followed two minutes later by an adult Bald Eagle on the same trajectory. Lastly, the final hours of the count did not fall short of raptors either... even a sub-adult Swainson's Hawk and a couple of female Kestrels circled a few times before continuing their southern migration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, a spectacular day enjoyed by the Hawkwatch team and all the raptor afficionados that made it to the Hill today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Christine Cariño&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Pat Bacchetti, Bob Blumberg, John Davis, Susan Greef, Carmen DeLeon, Laura Echávez&lt;br/&gt;

We had decent visibility for the first couple of hours, as the edge of the fog stayed close to the hill and was thin enough to spot some Broad-winged Hawks, American Kestrels, Merlins, and many Sharp-shinned Hawks as they rose and barreled over our heads. It was a rare sighting to spot one Sharpie at a time, as they all seemed to be trailed by two...three...or six more accipiter's; tumbling with talons out at times. Rapid barrel rolls and aerial rivalry, we love the drama and display up above!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We were greeted this morning by a group of students from USF who were on a field trip with their ornithology class. As much as we are fascinated by raptor ecology and movement, we are also thrilled to see how young biologists navigate and grow.

Winds started NE today but floated to NW by late afternoon, and mostly 64- 70 degrees and few clouds by 3 pm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sharp-shinned Hawks were contour-flying around the cars as we arrived at 930 am, so we made the call to get up and start counting pronto.  But not until after a moment of silence and acknowledgement for the heroic event of 60 years ago today: Rachel Carson's hugely impactful book, Silent Spring, was published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silent Spring links directly to the world of raptor migration as Rachel Carson used data from Hawk Mountain, PA, to provide evidence of the human and environmental disaster that was (and is) DDT.  The migration counts from Hawk Mt - given to Rachel by Maurice Broun in 1960 - showed a clear decline of Bald Eagle numbers post-1948 (year 1 of DDT use in the Northeast) and primarily a decline in juvenile birds.  Why juveniles?  Because DDT specifically attacks the reproductive system of female birds. So juveniles declined faster than adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, the Marin Headlands raptors came out in honor of Silent Spring and Rachel Carson - we had an incredible flight on Hawk Hill: 640 raptor-sightings, with 14 different species including four falcon spp. The flight began immediately this morning - Broad-winged and Sharp-shinned Hawks especially numerous, but also Cooper's, Redtails, and some Redshoulders started appearing among the patchy clouds under a light NE breeze.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Falcons showing up gradually with many direct south-bound flybys of Merlins and Kestrels. Twenty Kestrel sightings for the day!  A pair of adult Peregrines chasing the accipiters around, but a few juv Peregrines as well. A few Osprey and two Ferruginous Hawks plus four Harriers and a White-tailed Kite gave us a great range of species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Andrew Bradshaw, Mary Kenney&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Woody Woodbury, Jody Newman, Chris Tarr, Dan Foldes, Rich Eliason, Allen Fish - special thanks to NPS biologists Ana Arce and Morgan Barnes for joining us today and contributing some awesome spotting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

We returned to the hill around noon to check the weather status and enjoy our lunch downslope from the East quadrant, and we were pleasantly surprised to see many passing Accipiter's and a Broad-winged Hawk. We considered these observations as a good sign that we could get a couple hours of counting in for the day. So, that is exactly what we did!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And what a rich and productive couple of hours it was... Sharp-shinned Hawks were catapulting up over our heads, through every quadrant, then fading into the mist. A few Merlins' buzzed Hawk Hill, also trailing off into the clouds and quickly out of sight. Though the count team was on their toes and busy with the Raptor display above, we still had a moment to spot and observe the yellow-green crown and back contrasting with the gray face/chest/belly of a Chestnut-sided Warbler as it foraged in and out of the Coyote brush near the North quadrant. As the count team was descending the hill, a Northern Harrier teetered our way and accompanied us on our way out.

Temps started and ended at 59-degrees F, reaching a max of 62F at noon. However, the early morning breeze quickly turned to 15-mph gusts that catapulted Sharpies overhead while the team scrambled for their puffy layers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though the fog never fully lifted, we had many decent opportunities at viewing some incredible behaviors. To start off the day, a flock of ~40 Band-tailed Pigeons rushed over Kirby Cove, when an adult Redtail slowly descended upon them, feet down, and snatched a pigeon mid-air! What a feast that must have been for the Redtail! That was not the only raptor with prey on its mind though. We also observed a Peregrine Falcon swooping on potential prey -it dove straight towards the ground before making sharp U-turns in its attempts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strong winds fast-forwarded birds from our view, not only the Sharpies, but Kestrels and Merlins as well. Even the larger species were no match against the turbulent air. Whether they meant to or not, a handful of Cooper's Hawks zipped by today, while a young Northern Harrier rode the wind as it gracefully seesawed towards the south.

While it stayed right around 68-72 degrees F throughout the count time, the sunshine, wind, and fog brought us distinct phases of weather conditions with varying raptor flow. With dry air, bright sunshine, and zero wind it seemed like we could be in for a hot day with few raptors. An early sighting of a dark morph Broad-Winged Hawk that sailed in from the north and soared above the bay was a delight for all!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thankfully, the west wind finally woke up in the early afternoon with a gentle 3 mph breeze and absolutely clear skies. Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures began moving in small kettles over the Golden Gate and into the East Bay. Accipiters trickled through mixing in with the soaring kettles. As the breeze picked up, we were surprised to see 3 Merlins in a single hour each flapping fast (as MERLs do!) around the hill and across the bay. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later in the afternoon, those in North had clear skies while thick fog crept through the lagoon and loomed below the hill. As pillowy fog replaced our views of the ocean and bay in the southwest, the wind picked up to 10 mph. While visibility was limited in some areas, the fog seemed to push a flow of accips with Sharp-shinned Hawks fluttering fast in the wind and banking through the fog around the hill. We were excited to compare sharpies and coops side by side and get to finish the day with a fairly active hour. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadwing and Sharpie fans- we see you! Keep an eye on the skies and visit the hill often. Every day is its own adventure in nature.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Carmen DeLeon, Conservation &amp; Community Science Program Coordinator and Krista Fanucchi, GGRO Biotech &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Jane Rudebusch &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Lora Roame, Michael Voeltz, Maryrose Kulick, Sam Hontalas &lt;br/&gt;

By 230 pm, we had a rousing west wind, and with it, some more accips to finish the day with. AM temps started at 72-deg and finished at 80-deg at 3 pm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In our first half-hour an adult female Peregrine chose to alight on the railing at the west end of Hawk Hill and study the waters of the Golden Gate 900 feet below. She allowed us to watch her for some 10 mins before making an intercepting flight to catch up with the adult male travelling by at, well, falcon speed.  The two soared, flapped, and glided around the sky for a good 15 mins, forcing us to watch their every wingbeat, their flight configurations, and the various colors shone by the angle of the sun.  It was a terrible ordeal, but what can you do? Finally they flew off, allowing for a few more Sharp-shinned Hawks to fly cautiously across the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This wasn't a fast migration today. And much of it was quite high up. And never dull. We had great close looks at a juvenile Osprey (with white scalloped-edging on every back feather), and an adult Osprey (also a dorsal view showing multiple shades/ages of primaries and secondaries).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bunch of Red-shouldered Hawks appeared throughout the day, and a few Merlin and Kestrel flybys kept our eyes sharp.  Many dragonflies riding high thermals seemed to keep the Merlins engaged. A three-falcon day is always good. One distant, high Broad-winged at the end of the day was a nice bit of frosting on the cake. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-	Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Horacio Mena, Holly Thomas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Will Ludan, Tomas McKay, Connor Cimmiyotti, Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

They carried the promise of a more "normal" peak day for the program -and regardless of whatever normal means, we certainly had an amazing day on the Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The warmer temps and southern winds brought a wide array of raptors, and we finished the day at 11 species! In addition to the numerous Redtails and Turkey Vultures, a few other species were also sighted various times. Broadwings, Redshoulders, Ospreys, and Merlins were among the most exciting events! Oftentimes, many of the birds we see are far away, but maybe because of the slow winds today, a lot of them soared right over the team. Even a juvenile Golden Eagle circled right above, showing off the beautiful chocolatey colors and white patches!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other highlights also include some non-raptor migrants. Large flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons fluttered south within the first couple of hours of the count, and Vaux's Swifts zoomed by in big numbers throughout the entire day. Finally, 21 Monarch Butterflies also dashed across the Headlands, often being initially confused for a gliding Sharpie and impressing the team with their speedy flight! Overall, a fun day of counting for the Thursday Hawkwatch team!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Christine Carino &amp; Gretchen Zantzinger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Bob Blumberg, Pat Contaxis, Michaela Figari, Jim Yampolsky, Pauline Yeckley, Laura Echávez&lt;br/&gt;

A Red-shouldered Hawk rose from Gerbode Valley and quickly flap-flap-glided southwards. Two Peregrine Falcons guarded the entrance to the Bay as they sat atop the suspension cables of the Golden Gate Bridge. Cooper's Hawks fought the steady western winds as they rose in unison with the Redtails over the valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rest of the day was sprinkled with moments when a hawkwatcher would yell for an interesting bird and the entire team ran from different corners of the Hill -binoculars ready- to catch sight of the visitor. Soon after each of these occurrences, periods of little activity followed, allowing discussions on what we had just observed. One of these was not long after midday, when a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk appeared behind a handful of Redtails circling directly over Hawk Hill! Another highlight was the brief appearance of a Prairie Falcon spotted from the west low near the old rifle range and zipping out of the Headlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the last hour, the fog crept back into the Bay and around the Hill, and strong gusts of cold wind reminded the team of the looming storm.

Our team observed a gopher excavating on the hillside, causing small rocks to slide down, as we waited for the sky to clear. With the fog becoming patchy and the wind picking up, we headed to the hill and started counting at 10:30 AM. The temperatures ranged from 62-73 degrees F with patchy fog clearing to warm, blue skies around 1:30 PM. A steady wind from the west around 8-12 mph brought the beginning of the raptor flow we were most excited to see. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Though we were off to a slow start, we were delighted to see accipiters rising in the north and west with some great looks at Sharp-shinned Hawks side by side. An osprey gliding across Angel Island to the Golden Gate and several Red-shouldered Hawks made for a very fun afternoon!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special shout out to the students of Downtown High School from the Wilderness Arts and Literacy Collective. We wish you happy birding trails and appreciate you coming to the hill to learn about raptors. Don't hesitate to fly our way again soon! We'd love to have you on the team one day as you continue to explore the world of birds and photography.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Carmen DeLeon, Conservation and Community Science Program Coordinator &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Libby Rouan and Holly Thomas &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Laura Thomas, Sonja Raub, Conner Cimmiyotti, Horacio Mena, Yvette MacDonald, Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;

A steady 10-mph gust persisted for a couple of hours but slowed down after noon as the temps settled in the low to mid 60F.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though we are entering the peak of Accipiter migration, we have not observed them in their usual numbers. Fortunately, today's team had a streak of luck and saw the highest number of Accipiters seen so far as both Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks graced the Hill -a total of seven of each! However, the day got even more exciting right before lunchtime when a Broad-winged Hawk, our smallest Buteo, materialized out of the fog directly over the count site. Around that same time, a juvenile and an adult Peregrine Falcon perched on the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge, but the adult quickly chased the young bird off the bridge and into the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That would not be the only falcon species seen today though... A Merlin was spotted from the south as it pursued a White-throated Swift before making a straight line into San Francisco. Just as the day was coming to a close, our fearless leader, Christine, spotted an ephemeral Kestrel over Gerbode Valley, making this a three falcon species day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cap to the day was a juvenile Bald Eagle that appeared over Mount Tamalpais and flew right over us before disappearing into the glare of the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Christine Cariño&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Pat Bacchetti, Bob Blumberg, John Davis, Susan Greef, Carmen DeLeon, Laura Echávez&lt;br/&gt;

We got fogged out!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hawkwatchers met on the South side of Rodeo Lagoon to discuss Accipiter ID, hoping that the conversation and consideration would summon them our way. We then took a slow walk along the lagoon, stopping to peak at everything that flickered and flew from Willow to Cypress and back again. As we stood in the middle of a Eucalyptus grove, attempting to get a closer look at a couple of Warblers, a Great-horned Owl spread its wings and flew right above our heads before disappearing behind dense vegetation. We had been standing there for a few minutes or so, and had not noticed our feathered friend perched out on a limb, though it was surely watching us...  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Krista Faucchi, GGRO Assistant Biotechnician &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Don Bartling &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Linda Sudduth, John Davis, Sue Morgan, Jan Ambrosini, Joan Duffield, Krista Fanucchi &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach Support: Tim Stroshane &lt;br/&gt;

The fog wrap lingered throughout the day occasionally obscuring Tamalpais from view, and San Francisco as well.  Gusts from 8 to 20 mph out of the west, and temps from the mid 60's to 70-deg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not the break-out Accipiter day we have been waiting for but we did watch a steady stream of Red-tailed Hawks flap, glide, truck, cavort and careen across the sky mostly toward the SW. Other species highlights included 2 Sharp-shinned Hawks, 1 Merlin (first of the year for this little falcon), and an Osprey. In the morning, an adult Peregrine made several long sweeping stoops on the center summit of Hawk Hill trying to budge a too-sturdy covey of California Quail out of their coyote brush. Hats off to prey and predator for doing their best in this million-year-old dance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to GGRO banding manager Teresa Ely, banding dayleader Anne Ardillo, and bander Cricket Raspet, we enjoyed a mid-day banded Red-tailed Hawk release in honor of George Eade, the beloved GGRO volunteer, raptor conservationist and photographer who died in late July.  George's hawk was a intricately field-marked lighter-light morph juv Redtail that calmly rose from Teresa's release into the eye-level of the Hawkwatch, then spent some 5-10 mins just stilling next to Hawk Hill, eight binocular pairs transfixed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Andy Bradshaw, Mary Kenney&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Chris Tarr, Rich Eliason, Dan Foldes, Woody Woodbury, Jody Newman, Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

"We must be right on the edge of the fog" ... "It will definitely clear out soon" ... and my personal favorite "I really have no clue what the fog is about to do". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;West winds eventually picked up around noon and we enjoyed a solid 4-hour count. Red-tailed Hawks were seen hovering above Slacker ridge, stooping beyond middle kingdom, and soaring high overhead before trailing off in the direction of the Golden Gate Bridge. A Peregrine falcon was spotted in the Slacker saddle, and three Osprey gave hawkwatchers quite the show as they soared steadily in wide circles over Hawk Hill and beyond.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last bird of the day was also the only Accipiter we saw today!

The day started with an easy breeze and fog mantled over the entrance to the San Francisco Bay. For the first couple of hours, our Hawkwatch team saw a steady trickle of Redtails and Turkey Vultures, but we were hoping for some species variety -and, geez, did the raptors deliver!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This has been an unusually low year for Accipiters, particularly Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks. So when a juvenile Cooper's Hawk flew in a from the west and then rose over the north quadrant, all those atop Hawk Hill cheered with excitement. Then, not ten minutes after, a Swainson's Hawk rose from Gerbode Valley and circled higher with a few juvenile Redtails. Lastly, to top off the hour, a distant Osprey flew over Alcatraz Island, decidedly making its way south for the winter. The final hour of the count brought more highlights, including Peregrine Falcons and a misty Northern Harrier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the team was leaving Hawk Hill, an adult Cooper's Hawk flew right over us -could this be a sign of the Coops and Sharpies yet to come?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Becky Olsen &amp; Ken Wilson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Paul Meadow, Maggie Montenegro, Ana Maria Olivar, Kinley Renger, Carol Weinstein, Laura Echávez&lt;br/&gt;

The steady 10mph wind brought a constant stream of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures. We thought we would not see other species, but in the second half of the day we saw a couple of Cooper's Hawks, Red-shouldered Hawks, and American Kestrels (male &amp; female)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another highlight was a young couple from San Francisco that was visiting Hawk Hill for the first time and so excited to learn about the migration happening right in their backyard!

Things did start to pick up with the breeze around 1:00pm; some notable species being an adult male Northern Harrier (or "grey ghost"), a few Cooper's Hawks, a couple of Osprey, and a Peregrine Falcon.

At around 70F, the top of Hawk Hill felt balmy, but fortunately, temperatures did not rise over 80F, and cool winds kept us comfortable as we watched the Red-tailed Hawks passing through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today's flight was somewhat slow and the hawkwatch team wondered if all raptors had decided to boycott the migration. However, we did have some exciting highlights. We had a great view of an Osprey that flew at eye-level and hugged the north-northeast side of the Hill. We also saw a couple of Kestrels, one of which was showing off its acrobatic abilities while swooping over a young Redtail. Lastly, after rumors of Sharp-shinned Hawk sightings around the Headlands, we finally saw a Sharpshin during the official count!

Essentially one per minute for the first two hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few other species rounded out the day - several great Red-shouldered Hawk views, a handful of Coopers. We have still no Sharpshins on the official count, although a few have been seen around the valley this week.

During the first hour of the count, we had more non-raptor sightings than anything else as flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons, White-throated Swifts, and Blue-gray Gnatcatchers rushed by. We enjoyed a handful of Turkey Vultures, several Red-tailed Hawks, and a sprinkle of novelty species for the team: one Cooper's Hawk, one Northern Harrier, and an American Kestrel. The second hour of the day brought flurries of Redtails, mostly juveniles that zigzagged back and forth over Slacker Ridge -foreshadowing the theme of the day... However, it also brought an exciting bird and a first for the 2022 season: a Swainson's Hawk! It hugged the count site and lingered around the Hill for quite a while, giving the team plenty of time to "Ooh" and "Ahh" at its fascinating field marks. A cool and gentle northwesterly breeze picked up around noon, and for the rest of the day we mainly saw Redtails, interrupted by a distant Osprey, a Red-shouldered Hawk on a mission, and the occasional Turkey Vulture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A handful of visitors enjoyed the sight of the migrating hawks as well -some folks local to California and a small family from as far away as Poland!

Did we consider this sighting an early indicator that it would be a great day of Hawk counting? YES we did and it was, truly...  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hot weather and light, NW winds put birds high in blue skies for most of the afternoon. A sub-adult Bald Eagle accompanied by two Red-tailed Hawks, a swift Peregrine Falcon, a teetering Northern Harrier, and a high energy American Kestrel reminded me of how incredibly lucky we are to witness migrating raptors.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As I was packing up the gear and heading out for the day, I noticed a person looking intently at the sky with a smile stretched across their face. I turned to see a Juvenile Red-tailed Hawk soaring in a wide circle right above our heads, tilting its wings slightly to catch the breeze as two Ravens positioned themselves right behind the Hawk. This person asked what we were looking at, still smiling wide, and after learning that it was a Red-tail they simply responded "wow, this must be my lucky day", as they stood there staring until the bird lifted and disappeared out of sight. What a gift, to be overcome with gratitude.

Meanwhile, a river otter weaseled its way around the raft of pelicans as it gnawed on some shelled creatures. Great Egrets, Snowy Egrets, a Great Blue Heron, Barn Swallows, a Black Phoebe, and Common Yellowthroats were also a part of the show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a hawkwatch team, however, and raptors were indeed the highlight for today!

The highlight of the day was an adult Peregrine Falcon that materialized out of nowhere and stayed long enough for us to appreciate its beautiful slate-colored plumage. All in all, we had the highest number of species for our 2022 Hawkwatch day thus far and we're excited for the migrants that are slowly but surely making their way down the Pacific Flyway!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Laura Echávez, GGRO Senior Biotech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Christine Cariño&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Pat Bacchetti, Bob Blumberg, Arden Bucklin-Sporer, Laura Echavez, Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Sunshine! Fog! A flash of Blue Sky! Hawks! The weather up on Hawk Hill today was erratic, at one moment you had your eyes fixed on something, and the next your view was obstructed by a dense layer of fog. Strong, steady winds had some of us questioning our decision to only bring a few extra layers up to Hawk Hill for the day. One thing is for sure, the gusts shook us to our core and reminded us that migration is on.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For today's count, we observed 20.5 birds per hour. Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures appeared in kettles of up to 7 birds at a time over Slacker ridge and rose steadily beyond the Golden Gate bridge. A Cooper's Hawk blew up and over the hill and disappeared in a glide and into a veil of fog. A Northern Harrier, with its fluid and relaxed wingbeats, was seen carrying off a western fence lizard.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Don Bartling, Jon Altemus &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Linda Sudduth, John Davis, Sue Morgan, Jan Ambrosini, Joan Duffield, Krista Fanucchi &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach Support: Tim Stroshane &lt;br/&gt;

The great finger of Pacific fog extended into the Golden Gate and had piled up against the center span by 2 pm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We had a decent count day with more than 26 raptors per hour (rph) driven by gangs of juvenile Redtails, as many as six in a kettle at once.  A few Cooper's Hawks made early-season appearances, and an adult Peregrine capped the day at just 5 mins before quitting time. This blue-backed falcon zoomed onto the Pt. Diablo slope and then soared above Kirby Cove for a long 3 mins, before disappearing to the south. Lots of Blue-Gray Gnatcatchers about as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hawk Hill visitors today were from Oakland; Berkeley; Davis; Toronto, Canada; Toulouse, France; London, UK; and Moscow, Russia. One morning highlight was meeting Ricardo, a Parisian man riding his motorcycle from NW Territories to Argentina in 5 months. We marveled that he was matching the migration of our longest distance species - the Peregrine Falcons. He was happy to attach a GGRO sticker to the back of his bike.

Thick fog clung to the western face of Hawk Hill til 1 pm, then kept the Headlands a cool 70-degrees while the 360-degree view opened up in the afternoon. Nice to catch an Osprey riding down Slacker Ridge heading for the Golden Gate and parts south....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We collectively dedicate this 2022 Golden Gate migration season to the memory of George Eade, beloved friend, conservationist, photographer, outdoor educator, and raptor ecologist. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dayleaders&lt;/b&gt;: Deborah Crooks, Linda Schneider&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Count Team&lt;/b&gt;: Linda Chambers, Patty Lessard, Peter Sapienza, Wade Eakle, Denise Peck, Cheryl Lentini, Krista Fanucchi, Allen Fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outreach support&lt;/b&gt;: Holly Thomas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
