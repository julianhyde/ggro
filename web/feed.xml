And so we scaled the hill one last time, arriving to sheets of rain billowing down from above. After counting a few raptors here and there, we decided we had endured for as long as we could and descended to 1064 for a potluck feast. Fittingly enough, the season's last bird turned out to be an adult Redtail spotted stilling over South Slacker around 11 a.m. just before the rain washed us off the hill. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A big thank you goes out to all our hawkwatchers who made this sometimes trying but altogether memorable 2010 season a success. Hope to see you all up top next fall.&lt;br/&gt;

After a morning rain shower, a drizzle threatened the douse the day when the team arrived at Hawk Hill at 10:30. However, conditions improved to an ambient gray with faint winds and interesting cloud formations. There is not much in this entry about hawks because there were not many to be seen. After two hours of counting, the total stood at a whopping three. Though this improved to 60 by the end of the day, not much was moving in the Headlands today. The first Turkey Vulture didn't show up until 1:00, though the banders reported sighting a Ferruginous Hawk in the direction of the FM tower. Despite the low raptor numbers, what was to be had was a good time and good company as the season came to a close. Thanks to everyone for making hawkwatch a blast!&lt;br/&gt;

Highlights included a juvenile Red-shouldered hawk, a beautiful glimpse of a male American Kestrel, and a few Accipiters. We enjoyed our time together and with the hawks this season.

In between, however, the team treated itself to a fine potluck meal, fine drink, and a whopping 67 raptor sightings. A distinct lack of wind and the dropping barometer seemed to keep the raptors, including even those in Kirby Cove, perched and out of the skies. Although the hawks were almost uniformly high and distant, some lucky watchers got to take in an adult Cooper's Hawk before it disappeared behind Middle Kingdom, and a Northern Harrier was spotted in the North Saddle hanging out with two Turkey Vultures. Outside of raptors, the team diligently tallied tweets, including a charming Hermit Thrush, and nine different types of ocean-going vessels. It might have been a slow day, but spirits were high, and the season ended with good cheer.&lt;br/&gt;

After soup and salad, the ferrug decided to interrupt desert by rising up in front of Hill 88 and proceeding to meander around the Headlands for 15 long, luscious minutes, offering everyone up on Hawk Hill the opportunity to affix their gaze upon its gleaming white breast and pointed wings for as long as they liked. Truly a wonderful bird to end our season on. In addition to the Ferruginous Hawk, the day also featured the close inspection of a lovely White-tailed Kite and several head-turning looks at some swift Peregrine Falcons.&lt;br/&gt;

While the team feasted on chili, crab dip, coleslaw, cornbread, crackers, chips, and tasty hot drinks and deserts that did not begin with the letter "C" some raptors did pass through the headlands. At least three juvenile Red-tailed Hawks were seen flapping across the Golden Gate, and several juvenile Northern Harriers coursed the hills in search of prey. However, the only the Accipiter spotted by hawkwatch today had to be presented in the form of an ID study by Hawk Blind. Perhaps the haze that lingered all day will lift later in the week and more late hawks will pass through. As the end of another season for Tuesday II drew to a close, the resident ravens were circling, hoping to find some crumbs left behind from another good day on Hawk Hill.&lt;br/&gt;

Early on, a hawkwatcher in South quadrant spotted an enormous brown raptor over Conzelman Road. The bird was missing random flight feathers and had a scruffy appearance overall. Almost immediately after the bird appeared, an adult Red-tailed Hawk, who was perched nearby, sounded its battle cry and flew up to stoop on the mystery bird.  However, in terms of size, the Red-tailed Hawk was miniscule by comparison!  As the dark raptor flew right by Hawk Hill, the hawkwatchers looked up and saw white axillary feathers on the bird's underwing, which allowed us to identify the bird as a juvenile Bald Eagle!  But the fun didn't end there.  The hawkwatchers also were treated to great looks at a low flying Peregrine, a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk, and a light-morph Swainson's Hawk.  Finally, in the late afternoon, a magnificent bird with an exceedingly long neck was spotted over the ocean.  The bird turned out to be a Sandhill Crane, a species that is rarely seen in the Bay Area (these birds can be viewed in large numbers around the Central Valley and Delta during the winter)!  Overall, a fantastic day to be up on Hawk Hill!&lt;br/&gt;

This included your garden variety raptors as well as twelve Northern Harriers, a White-tailed Kite, seven Peregrine Falcons, and an intermediate-morph Swainson's Hawk.  The Swainson's Hawk was first spotted over Wolfback Ridge, and stuck around long enough for many of the Hawkwatchers to observe it in a spotting scope.  Of the adult Peregrine Falcons counted, several swept right over the top of Hawk Hill, allowing those Hawkwatchers with cameras to snap some excellent ventral shots of the birds.  One of the Peregrines flew so low over the hill that we could make out its enormous bulging crop with our naked eye!  Talk about a serious snack!  The count ended with two juvenile Northern Harriers who were spotted having a comical play-fight above Rodeo Valley Trail.  Thanks for a fantastic season Sunday I!&lt;br/&gt;

Quite a few Red-tailed Hawks flew close by overhead, and a juvenile White-tailed Kite flew by at close range early in the morning. Other birds spotted included several Northern Harriers, a few male American Kestrels, and a speedy Merlin which was being attacked by an adult Red-tail. It had no trouble evading the bigger bird. Then, at nearly 3:30 the banders reported seeing a Rough-legged Hawk on Middle Kingdom; however, it was perched on the opposite side of the hill from hawkwatch, and when it flew, the hawkwatchers could not spot it. A thorough and excited scour of the petri dish field found only one juvenile Northern Harrier and two dueling juvenile Red-tails. They alternately sulked in coyote bushes and tangled on the ground, one on its back, the other standing on top. Although it was fun to watch the wrestling match the team would have preferred to snag the pizza bird. Despite the lack of luck in that department, the hawkwatchers are going to enjoy an end-of-season meal at Dario's anyway.&lt;br/&gt;

West had it first, then it made its way over to Middle Kingdom and Slacker, showing off its golden head and bright white tail. Everyone on the hill was able to enjoy great looks at this spectacular bird. Earlier in the day, the team had a field day with Northern Harriers, spotting nine all told including a female and several pumpkin-breasted juveniles. Few Accipiters were to be had, with one adult Sharp-shinned paying a morning visit followed by a few juveniles. However, the Red-tailed Hawks were in fine form. Two adults took turns stooping on a juvenile in Kirby Cove, and several soared over the hill. Other notable raptors included a there-and-gone Merlin and a White-tailed Kite. Fun non-raptors included a group of Glaucous-winged Gulls and a floatilla of Surf Scoters. The 175 hawks--and assorted tweets--that graced Hawk Hill today made it a fine end to Thursday I's season.&lt;br/&gt;

During the early going, a sizable number of juvenile Red-tailed Hawks were joined by a few juvenile Cooper's Hawks and a wonderful juvenile Ferruginous Hawk who showed off a bit for the onlookers below before making its way toward the city. Later on in the day, the juvenile Bald Eagle graced us with its presence circling up high well over our heads before gliding away. Additionally, there was some speculation that a pair of large raptors flying steadily over San Francisco were in fact Golden Eagles but the birds were first sighted at a great distance and identification could not be confirmed. They both went down as unidentified raptors.        &lt;br/&gt;

Red-tailed Hawks were fairly active throughout the day and a few American Kestrels, a lone Cooper's Hawk and a Peregrine Falcon were also seen. The day's highlight proved to be a distant White-tailed Kite repeatedly diving at a Redtail that must have been doing something exceedingly irritating.  &lt;br/&gt;

Red-tailed Hawks dominated the count but Peregrine Falcons stole the show. Peregrines were spotted circling up over Hawk Hill, shooting through the clouds over Alcatraz and, on several occasions, diving at Red-tailed Hawks who had the misfortune of wandering into their airspace. They proved to be quite the spectacle on this day.    &lt;br/&gt;

The day started with a drizzle and ended with looming storm clouds. The south winds did not bring many hawks, either. A total of 73 were tallied, and among those birds were only two Accipiters (two Sharp-shinned Hawks). However, four Peregrine Falcons came overhead, and a pair of Red-tailed Hawks--one adult and one juvenile--put on a show of dog fighting for several minutes with spectacular stoops and rolls. With a dark, menacing cloud approaching from the north, the watch was called an hour early.&lt;br/&gt;

The team saw great variety of raptors today, including several Ferruginous Hawks, a Swainson's Hawk, a handful of dark morph Red-tailed Hawks, and two White-tailed Kites.

The Hawkwatch team counted a fairly steady stream of raptors all day long.  Several raptors including a male Northern Harrier, a White-tailed Kite, and a beautiful dark brown Red-tailed Hawk right sailed right past the Hawkwatch (to our delight!).  At the end of the day, the team also was able to see GGRO's new telemetry bird, a juvenile female Red-tailed Hawk, released from Hawk Hill.  The GGRO telemetry team will track this bird in order to collect data on Red-tailed Hawk migration/dispersal patterns in California.&lt;br/&gt;

Several Sharp-shinned Hawks again paid the hill a close visit, rising out of Kirby Cove and circling at close quarters. Juvenile Northern Harriers also provided some entertaining looks out over the valley and a handful of Merlins shot the Golden Gate, southbound. Finally, a Cooper's Hawk thrashed energetically around a coyote bush on the slope of Rocky Ridge, frenetically trying to flush a small bird. It eventually succeeded but its prey and it escaped out of the hawkwatchers' sight.&lt;br/&gt;

Fortunately, the wind died down after an hour or so, leaving the team with a beautiful day. The count was good for the first several hours, and some Sharp-shinned Hawks were spotted at close quarters as they wrapped around the hill, pushed by the wind. But the day's highlight was watching a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk stoop on one of the blinds and be captured successfully. As the day went on, the raptor flow died down: hawks, it seems, do not change their clocks, so by 3:00 the skies were pretty empty. At the end of the day four species had reached double-digit numbers--Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, Sharp-shinned Hawks, and Cooper's Hawks--and nine species had been seen.&lt;br/&gt;

Red-shouldered Hawks were the spectacle early as a handful of birds, including a brightly red-breasted adult, were seen here and there during the morning. Red-tailed Hawks and Cooper's Hawks dominated the midday hours before a few furious falcons entered the fray and grabbed the attention of the group near day's end when a 2:00 Merlin blasted through the sky and a smattering of adult Peregrine Falcons circled up over the hill, delighting the pleased onlookers below.   &lt;br/&gt;

Our first sighting was an Osprey, and then a juvenile Peregrine passed right by the hill. The skies were clear, the wind was just a light breeze and off in the distance to the northwest we saw a juvenile Bald Eagle! It came closer as it headed south, passing by us and heading over the Gate into San Francisco. We were able to tell from its plumage that it was likely in its first year. We saw the usual suspects for the rest of the day, most of them up high. We had several Merlins come by, always exciting. The clouds rolled in at around 2:30 and we started to feel some rain drops, so we high-tailed it off the hill.&lt;br/&gt;

The morning was dominated by Peregrine Falcon activity with several adult and juvenile birds seen. At one point, the team was split between watching two adult Peregrines circling high in the clouds overhead and a juvenile Peregrine slashing through the sky over Slacker Hill. Later on after the Peregrine show came to an end, a trio of tantalizing birds created quite a lot of buzz up on the hill. The first was a juvenile Swainson's Hawk making a rare early November appearance in the Headlands. Next was an adult female Northern Harrier who rose up right in front of the hill offering up splendid looks. And last was a bird still being discussed by hawkwatchers hours after it was spotted, a possible light morph Harlan's Hawk that circled up and then made a beeline for Kirby Cove.        &lt;br/&gt;

(For more see the ggro.org main page.) The Saturday II team made it to the hill, sans construction hats and vests for the first time in 2010 only to find that a thick bank of fog had rolled in. After sticking it out for about three hours, they headed back down and took a walk on the Bobcat Trail. There a Kestrel was harassing a Red-tailed Hawk and a coyote was hunting rodents. The fog did eventually clear, revealing a beautiful day, but only after the hawkwatchers' day had been called. However, everyone enjoyed the return to "normalcy" on Hawk Hill.&lt;br/&gt;

The day started off with strong northeast winds which slowly backed off throughout the afternoon and eventually swung around to the north. Leading the species count were Red-tailed Hawks, followed closely by Turkey Vultures. Cooper's Hawks and Sharp-shinned Hawks were also on tap all day. The Sharpies in particular had to fight the morning's wind and many shot around the hill with wings tucked. Rarer hawks seen included Northern Harriers, one of which was a male, seven Peregrine Falcons, and one dark-morph Swainson's Hawk, which was escorted by two adult Red-tails and one disgruntled Peregrine. The team picked up its tenth species in the last fifteen minutes of watching--a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk that winged in from Mt. Tamalpais.&lt;br/&gt;

Buoyed by a bountiful early November Sharpie flight that included a good-sized number of blue-backed, rufous-barred adults, the Wednesday II team tallied the largest hawks per hour total in a little over two weeks during a pleasant near six hour day up on the hill. In addition, the team was also treated to a wonderfully close encounter with a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk who rose up from the valley and circled the hill before departing in the direction of San Francisco. And before that Ferruginous Hawk made its presence felt, the team got to glimpse an adult Peregrine Falcon making a spectacular dive on a juvenile Peregrine most unwelcome in its airspace. &lt;br/&gt;

At the end of the afternoon, the team had tallied 249 hawks representing 7 species. The day's highlight by far were the 15 Merlins seen from the hill. Four seen in the morning were supplemented by 11 in the afternoon, by which time "Merlin, schmerlin" jokes were in order. Not only were they plentiful, several passed close by, affording good looks, and at least one was seen nabbing a dragonfly in midair and it eating on the wing. Also exciting was a group of 4 White-tailed Kites that winged up the valley, showing off their beautiful plumage. Other birds seen included early-morning large flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons, and--of more importance--good numbers of Accipiters and Red-tailed Hawks.&lt;br/&gt;

Apparently, the hawks thought so too, because they were out and about in full force.  Today's Hawkwatch team counted ten species of raptors for a total count of nearly three hundred birds.  White-throated Swifts and Violet-green Swallows also filled the skies in the early morning, catching bugs and performing loop-de-loops in the air.  Adult and juvenile Red-tailed comprised the majority of raptorial birds counted.  Several groups of these adult Red-tails were spotted talon grappling during the day.  Peregrines, Merlins, and White-tailed Kites were also observed powering on through the Headlands.  If the nice weather keeps up, tomorrow's Hawkwatch team should get to observe some great birds as well.&lt;br/&gt;

All four birds flew near or directly over the hill, providing nice looks. Other birds seen included a smattering of Accipiters, both juveniles and adults. They tended to pop up from Kirby Cove and power quickly across the Golden Gate, looking for sunny skies to the south. As the afternoon progressed, fewer hawks were sighted, but two Common Ravens appeared and croaked sweetly to each other, providing entertainment for the hawkwatchers.&lt;br/&gt;

Thursday I's hawkwatch team anticipated the possibility of a rainy day, but found only gray skies and peculiar cloud formations on the hill. The team also found hawks, but had only 110 total sightings. Leading the coolness pack, however, were two dark-morph birds: an adult Red-tailed Hawk and a juvenile Swainson's Hawk. Both provided good looks. Sharp-shinned Hawks beat out Cooper's Hawks by far, at 30 to 4, and in an unusual move, the team sighted more Red-tailed Hawks than Turkey Vultures. The weather cooperated all day long, with not a single drop of rain falling, all four bridges in view to the south, and the wind only picking up in the last hour or so. &lt;br/&gt;

The Swainson's Hawk, first sighted low against the rolling hills of the Headlands, eventually rose up and sailed right over a delighted group of hawkwatchers offering up spectacular looks. The day was also a good one for Northern Harriers, adult Sharp-shinned Hawks and especially Merlins, several of whom sped by the hill for up close and personal encounters. Songbird-wise, Varied Thrushes continue to be seen in greater numbers and a few more Evening Grosbeaks also graced us with their presence.       &lt;br/&gt;

Although the Hawkwatch team was not inundated with thousands of birds in the sky, we did count eleven raptor species today!  Clear skies and westerly winds for most of the day served as the perfect conditions for a raptor flight.  Everyone was particularly delighted to see a beautiful juvenile Golden Eagle rise up in front of Mt. Tamalpais.  The Hawkwatch team also spotted several Merlin powering through the Headlands today.  One of them was catching dragonflies on the wing and eating them like popcorn!  For all those birders out there, a handful of Pine Siskins, a Red Crossbill, and two dozen Greater White-Fronted Geese were also observed from Hawk Hill. &lt;br/&gt;

A slow morning turned into a wild afternoon as the team attempted to juggle several groups of birds during an end of day flurry. Multiple Merlins darted through the sky. A host of Red-tailed Hawks, several dark morphs included, came in out of the clouds. Two Northern Harriers bobbed and weaved near Slacker Hill. A far-off Peregrine Falcon buzzed the FM tower. And a lone juvenile Golden Eagle popped up from behind the pines--all in the last two hours of the watch. Happy after such a great rush of birds, the team descended the hill at 3:30 p.m. &lt;br/&gt;

As Saturday II discovered today, the weather does not stand for second-guessing. So while the team was expecting rain, they found a clear hill beneath gray skies. However, hawkwatch was still not possible today because, in slightly less famous words, it's also never a good idea to second guess  construction sites. Somehow, both points of access to Hawk Hill were blocked or locked off from the hawkwatchers. Stymied but not defeated, the group did some headlands birding, found an adult Red-tailed Hawk and a floatilla of Western Grebes, and adjourned to Mill Valley where additional birds were to be found, including a large flock of Willets and a bridge Peregrine--just not &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; bridge Peregrine. It is hoped that following the forecast rains this weekend, the skies will fill with raptors to entertain next week's hawkwatchers.&lt;br/&gt;

The raptor flow was slow, with only 218 counted in nearly six hours, but adult Accipiters have been coming through, and they continued today. Good looks were to be had at several that flew right overhead. Other highlights included eight male American Kestrels, one of which perched at the top of a tree and showed off, and a pumpkin-orange juvenile Northern Harrier. &lt;br/&gt;

We saw some fantastic birds today, including a juvenile Peregrine Falcon that attacked a Cooper's Hawk and then flew right over the Hawkwatch team, and a juvenile Broad-winged Hawk that popped up around the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Several White-tailed Kites and adult accipiters also materialized out of the fog.  Evening Grosbeaks and Red Crossbills were also spotted on the hill today.

A couple of Broad-winged Hawks paid the hill a visit, as did a White-tailed Kite and many adult Accipiters. Toward the end of the day's count, the fog in the bay caused the migrants to stack up and form confused kettles among the ever-present Turkey Vultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, at the lagoon, ninety minutes of birdwatching yielded 41 species, including such highlights as an Elegant Tern, excellent looks at songbirds including a pair of Common Yellowthroats, a dive-bombing Brown Pelican, a juvenile Black-crowned Night Heron, and three species of raptor.&lt;br/&gt;

However, the intermittent periods of dense fog, persistent heavy rain, and the overall lack of hawks in the sky, gradually wore away our resolve.  A few Song Sparrows, Band-tailed Pigeons, and one Red-shafted Flicker kept us entertained for the brief period of time we were on Hawk Hill. Heavy rain forced us to retire from Hawk Hill around 10:30am.  Back at Fort Cronkhite, The Hawkwatch team decided that a field trip was in order, so we all headed up to the Marine Mammal Center.  It was fascinating to see the Elephant seals Mirounga angustirostris) and California Sea Lions (Zalophus californianus) in the rehabilitation pens and learn about the typical species that annually cycle through the center.  &lt;br/&gt;

For one hour! We had been waiting out the fog at the Annex and then took a trip to the base of the bridge when we saw some clearing on the Hill. We hurried to the top only to find the fog was closing in again. The Annex reported Peregrine and Broad-wing sightings but all we saw was fog and a few other birds. The ravens were happy to see us.&lt;br/&gt;

On this occasion, fog below and sun above morphed into fog everywhere. Winds were fairly strong, but topped out at less than 20 miles per hour. Before visibility completely closed up, the team was treated to fogtastic views of the bay and several kettles of Turkey Vultures, who were showing off their flying abilities above the clouds. The local Red-tailed Hawks spent their morning hunting the hill above Kirby Cove, in and out of the fog tendrils.&lt;br/&gt;

Since it was Thursday I's first day of counting, the team was relieved to be free of the fog--though it meant dealing with inhospitable temperatures it was finally possible to count hawks. The team was rewarded with good looks at multiple Red-tailed Hawks and Cooper's Hawks that soared close overhead, as well as sightings of two Osprey and a handful of American Kestrels and Northern Harriers. The day's highlight, though, was a pair of falcons: a magnificent adult Peregrine Falcon on its way south, and an unusually late Prairie Falcon that came roaring through the headlands on a beeline for San Francisco.&lt;br/&gt;

The morning was still pretty busy, and we did see a good number of Broad-winged hawks, a few adult Accipiters and a White-tailed Kite, and an adult Red-shouldered hawk. One of the juvenile Broad-winged hawks came in very close to the hill and we had a thrilling look at it as it swept by. In the non-raptor category, we saw about 50 Violet-Green Swallows and a few Cedar Waxwings, Meadow Larks, and Varied Thrushes.&lt;br/&gt;

Temperatures hovered around the mid-70s throughout with a slight breeze from the northwest. A midday spurt of raptors, mainly Red-tailed Hawks, Cooper's Hawks and Sharp-shinned Hawks, was bracketed by periods of idleness in the early and late going. Broad-winged Hawks continued to stream by and there was a noticeable uptick in the number of adult accipiters beginning to join the many juveniles on their southward migration. On the songbird front, the first Varied Thrush seen this season was spotted early in the morning just as the team ascended the hill.  &lt;br/&gt;

Although the weather was cooperative with bright sun and light winds, the flow of hawks was light. The number of blue steel birds seemed to outnumber the hawks in the last hour, when the team had to scour the hills to add a falcon--an American Kestrel--to the count. Earlier in the day the team did get to observe an adult male Northern Harrier and aerial courtship displays from the local pair of Red-tailed Hawks that live in Kirby Cove. Also in the skies, the hawkwatchers' perspective made it seem that the fighter jets were stooping on passing Accipiters, but all of the real birds merely continued their flights south, no doubt puzzled by all the racket overhead.&lt;br/&gt;

Highlights today included a distant dark-morph juvenile Broad-winged hawk as well as a juvenile Ferruginous hawk and an adult Cooper's hawk.

This proved to be the case when five White-tailed Kites surprised everyone by flying directly over the observation site!  The team also spotted three immature Golden Eagles today, one of which was close enough to see without the aid of binoculars.  Finally, when a juvenile Broad-winged Hawk appeared above the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge and then flew right by the Hawkwatchers, this was really the icing on the cake.  The kettles of fifteen or more Turkey Vultures that formed near Hawk Hill were also nothing short of spectacular! Our count of six hundred and sixty-nine raptors currently stands as the highest hawk count this season! Clear skies, westerly winds, and warm weather thermals created the perfect conditions for raptor watching.   &lt;br/&gt;

Today also set the season-high for both Merlins and Northern Harriers as eight Merlins and 12 Northern Harriers made an appearance on the count sheet. Songbird-wise, a handful of Northern Flickers &#151; most of which were Red-shafted but some of which were clearly intergrades between Yellow-shafted and Red-shafted &#151; busied themselves in the scrub near our alternate hawkwatching site early in the day. &lt;br/&gt;

Although the total number of raptors counted was not the all-time high for this season, we did count fourteen hawk species!  This included everything from White-tailed Kites and Golden Eagles (the first of the season) to Broad-winged Hawks and Ferruginous Hawks.  We also witnessed some hilarious aerial scuffles.  At one point, a juvenile Cooper's hawk ran into an adult Peregrine in the air, and the Peregrine did a few "log rolls."  Then the Peregrine proceeded to scream its head off.  A juvenile Ferruginous hawk that was minding its own business happened upon this scene, and was promptly harassed and bumped by the Peregrine.  This peregrine was then joined by another, and they circled the area, screaming back and forth at each other.  I guess the moral of this story is "don't mess with big falcons!"&lt;br/&gt;

Although the outlook for the day appeared bleak, the team decided to observe raptors from the level of the Annex, with the hope that the fog would eventually clear. At the Annex, we were happy to observe several accipiters and White-tailed Kites hunting the South Slacker ridge. When the fog began to lift around 10:30 a.m., we decided to head up the hill and start counting raptors.  Considering our later start time, we still counted a significant number of raptors today.  The majority of raptors we saw included Turkey Vultures, adult Red-tailed Hawks, juvenile Cooper's Hawks, and juvenile Sharp-shinned Hawks.  We also saw a fair number of American Kestrels and one Merlin.&lt;br/&gt;

Some Turkey Vultures and a Kestrel were also seen in the Headlands today but, unfortunately, the top of Hawk Hill was not. Maybe next time it will be clear?&lt;br/&gt;

The morning was overcast but visibility was good, and by the afternoon the wind had picked up and the skies had cleared. A total of 260 hawks winged past the hawkwatchers, for an average of 52 hawks per hour. Sharp-shinned Hawks were the best-represented species, with 67 total individuals counted, including one adult that showed off its blue back. Cooper's Hawks were sparser, coming in at 29. Merlins and Kestrels put in appearances, along with Peregrine Falcons, one of which put on a spectacular show by stooping on an unfortunate Sharp-shinned Hawk. Other sightings included an early afternoon Osprey directly overhead and two Northern Harriers, one an adult mail.&lt;br/&gt;

When the group met in the morning, they birded briefly around the visitor center in hopes of seeing a Black-and-white Warbler then headed up to attempt a hawkwatch. However, strong winds dense fog, and no visibility greeted them, so they retreated to a sheltered spot and waited for the rest of the morning. In the afternoon, the fog opened up around Kirby Cove, so the group got in some birding at the Annex, where the local Red-tails and some Accipiters were to be seen.&lt;br/&gt;

Great scope looks at three juvenile Broad-winged Hawks and an adult Swainson's Hawk making its way across the Bay toward San Francisco proved to be the highlights. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Falcons abounded as well with five Merlins, five American Kestrels and three Peregrine Falcons all announcing their presence. The Merlin abundance was a special treat, especially since several came shooting right by the hill allowing for spectacular looks as the birds headed south. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were even some interesting migrant songbirds out and about: Townsend's and Yellow Warblers, Horned Larks, Pine Siskins, Violet-green and Northern Rough-winged Swallows and hundreds of Vaux's Swifts to name a few.

Temperatures reached into the mid-nineties, and winds were light from the north. The team was greeted by three Northern Harriers and some morning Kestrels. Many good looks of Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks were to be had as they rode the thermals south, and six Merlins transited through as well.  However, the highlights of the day were excellent, long looks at some spectacular birds. A juvenile Broad-winged Hawk showed off in the Golden Gate for over five minutes (others of its compatriots soared high above in kettles of vultures and Accipiters), and a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk shot out of the north and circled in front of the hill, affording a great view for all. The grand rara avis finale came when an adult dark-morph Ferruginous Hawk came gliding in from beneath the FM tower and proceeded to circle up, slowly gaining altitude and finally melting away into the East Bay.&lt;br/&gt;

A generally northwest wind helped push a nice, if somewhat intermittent, flight through the headlands, and the hawkwatchers saw a total of 429 raptors. Among those birds were several stand-out species including Ferruginous Hawk, Swainson's Hawk, Merlin, and White-tailed Kite. The hill was also visited by numerous juvenile Cooper's and Sharp-shined Hawks, many of which afforded watchers great looks before they set out to points south. A handful of Peregrine Falcons and Red-shouldered Hawks helped to round out an eleven-species day.&lt;br/&gt;

Other species seen included an Osprey, a few Peregrine Falcons, and Red-shouldered Hawks. The sky was blue and the sun was out, so many good looks were available, although as the wind strengthened holding binoculars steady on distant birds. Highlights included views of Sharp-shinned Hawks and Cooper's Hawks dog-fighting before heading south across the Golden Gate.&lt;br/&gt;

The accipiters are officially moving en masse! When the team first arrived at our alternate hawk counting site, the fog was sitting low over the ocean.  However, around 10 a.m., the fog rose and reduced visibility on the hill to less than 0.1 mi.  Although we were discouraged, the fog cleared again by 11 a.m., to everyone's relief.  That's when the excitement began.  Sharp-shinned Hawks started filling the skies around 11 a.m. and increased in number until 3 p.m. Cooper's Hawks really started popping up between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.  Today's Hawkwatch team was also happily surprised by the appearance of two juvenile Broad-winged Hawks over the bay!  One of these birds flew right by the count site.  These are the first Broad-winged Hawks to be counted by Hawkwatch this season.  We also observed one White-tailed Kite hovering by the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Juvenile Red-tailed Hawks and juvenile Sharp-shinned Hawks comprised the majority of the total count today.   &lt;br/&gt;

This left the team feeling pretty optimistic about the rest of the day.  However, when the fog rolled in around 10 a.m., visibility on Hawk hill was substantially reduced.  A short time after that, it began to drizzle.  No birds were counted from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. This being the case, the Hawkwatch team decided to throw in the towel for the day.  &lt;br/&gt;

There are raptors out there, but they are difficult to spot in the thick Headlands fog. Maybe next time, Saturday I.&lt;br/&gt;

Good looks were to be had at male and female Kestrels, many juvenile Red-tails including some dark morphs, and an adult Cooper's Hawk. Meanwhile, the Peregrine Falcon stood sentry on the north tower. The highlight of the day came when a Bald Eagle chose to pay the Headlands a visit. At the end of the day, the team had tallied a total of 214 hawks representing 8 species at a rate of 38.9 per hour.&lt;br/&gt;

However, we decided to stroll around the lagoon at Fort Cronkhite, and saw a Western Sandpiper, a Least Sandpiper, a Green Heron, and several Yellow Warblers. After a brief stop at the Headlands Visitor's Center (to fuel up on hot chocolate), we made our way up to the annex on Conzelman road (to see if the fog had receded there at all).  Visibility was still poor there, but we did happen to see three adult Red-tailed Hawks talon-grappling over Rodeo Lagoon.  Hopefully tomorrow's Hawkwatch team will have better luck!&lt;br/&gt;

Raptor-wise, a few Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures were spotted as was the adult male Peregrine Falcon manning his post on the North Tower. &lt;br/&gt;

The temperature peaked around noon with a high of eighty-seven degrees Fahrenheit.  Later in the afternoon, winds from the WSW picked up speed and helped cool off the Hawkwatch team.  Juvenile Red-tailed Hawk were seen more than any other type of raptor today.&lt;br/&gt;

This limited the visibility from Hawk Hill.  However, the fog receded by eleven o'clock, and by mid-afternoon, the Hawkwatch team was able to spot birds several miles away with their spotting scopes. For all of you Osprey and American Kestrel fans out there, today was the day to see those birds up close.  The Hawkwatch team was privileged to see nine Osprey and twelve American Kestrels during our count!  One of the American Kestrels flew by with several hummingbirds in hot pursuit!  Juvenile Cooper's Hawks and one Sharp-shinned Hawks also flew in fairly close to the Hawkwatch team, which allowed new Hawkwatchers to practice their accipiter identification skills.  So far, this was one highest hawk counts for the GGRO 2010 season.&lt;br/&gt;

We were treated to a display from the bridge Peregrine almost as soon as we arrived, and the rest of the day was rather slow, although we enjoyed watching George and his family circle through. Late in the day, a couple of bold juvenile Red-tails were seen crossing the foggy strait, heading southward. A total of 38 hawks were counted, for 9.1 hawks per hour.&lt;br/&gt;

The Hawkwatch team was also treated to some great close-up views of juvenile Red-shouldered hawks adult and Peregrine Falcons.  At one point, two Peregrine were spotted perching next to each other on the Golden Gate Bridge! Several Osprey and American Kestrels were also seen in the Headlands today.&lt;br/&gt;

However, seeing two Osprey, which appeared to be heading south, zoom over our heads, made up for the extremely windy weather!  We also observed several American Kestrels, a few Northern Harriers, and one Cooper's hawk with a gigantic bulging crop (looked like it just had a big snack!). The majority of raptors we saw today were juvenile Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures. Good luck to tomorrow's Hawkwatch team!&lt;br/&gt;

Sightings were up a little too. Two hundred and forty-two total hawks were observed, and Turkey Vultures and juvenile Red-tailed Hawks again were the most common raptors.

So, we hiked up to Hawk Hill and started counting raptors at 10:45 a.m.  It turned out to be a great day to hawk watch!  The fog gave way to the warm sun by noon, and after that, we could see all the way to Mount Tamalpais.  Gentle winds from the NNW direction predominated during the day.  The most common species seen today were Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures.  The Red-tailed hawks were mainly playful, awkward juveniles, who hung around the Headlands for several hours. We also saw several female American Kestrels and juvenile Red-shouldered hawks.  The total number of hawks counted today was 152 hawks.  Since we counted hawks for 4.75 hours, our rate of hawks per hour was 32.  Hopefully tomorrowâ&#128;&#153;s Hawkwatch will also enjoy great weather and have plenty of raptors to watch!&lt;br/&gt;

We spent some time at the Annex waiting for the skies to clear slightly and finally made it up to Hawk Hill around noon. Visibility was fair with the fog continuing to lift, although the sun really didn't break through until about 2:30. Today was mostly a practice run and we only spent three hours on the hill, but we did see a lot of Turkey vultures and some Red-tailed hawks playing around in the sky. The only other raptor species we saw was an osprey, although we did spot a dark morph juvenile Red-tail! Our total count was 84 raptors in 3.25 hours with a rate of 25.8 hawks per hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Hopefully the fog will clear for Friday's team!&lt;br/&gt;

And the season&#146;s first American Kestrel, a female zooming by fast and low, wrapped up the day nicely.      &lt;br/&gt;

Because it was our first day at our alternate hawkwatching site, we spent some time arranging people and scopes to determine the best viewing quadrants and ended up with five viewpoints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We saw many Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed hawks and one of each common Accipiter species. There were two Peregrines and one Red-shoulder that flew by as well. Hoping for more hawks and clear skies tomorrow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
You may have seen one or two test messages on Facebook and Twitter floating by. Please ignore these! I'm just checking that the plumbing still works, so we can publish daily hawkwatch numbers starting from Monday.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
2010 is going to be a strange season for GGRO Hawkwatch. Due to &lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/goga/parknews/2010-0324.htm"&gt;ongoing work on Conzelman Road&lt;/a&gt;, we don't have access to Hawk Hill on Mondays through Fridays, so we will be counting from a remote alternate site on those days. On weekends, the Hawkwatch team will be on Hawk Hill but access is still prohibited to the general public. The hawkwatching will be different enough from the two locations that we expect our alternate site's data will not be quantitively comparable with past years' data. However, we don't want to pass up the chance to do some regular hawkwatching this season to get a good qualitative feel for the 2010 flight.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Since the public will not be allowed to visit Hawk Hill until possibly November, we are setting up a new public hawkwatching and interpretive site just for weekends in September and October.  Known as the Annex, this is the large four-bench turnout on Conzelman Road just before you hit the Upper Conzelman Road locked fog gate.  We will station GGRO docents there from 10 am to 2 pm during all clear weekend days in September and October.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We don't know how this will all turn out, but we do know three things: it's going to be an interesting season; there are going to be lots of beautiful raptors in the skies; and you can follow it all here, via the Facebook feed. Stay tuned.&lt;br/&gt;

A rather slow day, with only five species, but we got to see quite a spectacle when two Red-tails talon-grappled and went plummeting down quite a ways before letting go.  We left the hill just in time for it to rain on our cars as we drove back to the office.  Thanks for a great season, Sunday II!  &lt;br/&gt;
