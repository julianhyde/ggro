We were challenged periodically by distant kettles of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures. Occasionally, a Northern Harrier would join the kettles to spice things up.  We also got some close visits by Peregrine Falcons and a few Sharp-shinned Hawks, but saw surprisingly few Cooper's Hawks today (only 2!). A Humpback Whale also spent over an hour feeding in the Golden Gate within full sight of our Hawkwatch team, which was a real treat. (The other treat we got to enjoy today was our pizza, earned last Sunday 2 for seeing the first Rough-legged Hawk of the season!) &lt;br/&gt;

Nevertheless, the team persisted and the wind picked up, bringing raptors by Hawk Hill and toward San Francisco. Some of the first birds to appear were dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks scattered in with their light-morph counterparts and a potential light Harlan's Red-tailed Hawk, which joined the distant kettle. While the number of Red-tailed Hawk sightings remained high, we have been seeing fewer and fewer Accipiters over the past week. The day ended on a high note with the team riveted by the sight of an adult male Harrier mobbing two juvenile Red-tailed Hawks.&lt;br/&gt;

As is typical for this time of year, our number of Accipiters has decreased steadily and has made for emptier skies. We did have some nice looks at Merlins today, including one that buzzed by Hawk Hill two minutes before we ended our count. Besides a few close birds, the majority of our sightings were high and distant, giving us an added challenge in the identification process. Luckily, with the help of spotting scopes, lots of eyes, and decades of experience among our volunteers, we were able to pick up some special raptors, including Friday II's first Ferruginous Hawk of the year! &lt;br/&gt;

Almost immediately after beginning the count, the team got a magnificent look at a juvenile dark-morph Rough-legged Hawk that flew directly over Hawk Hill. Shortly after, a pair of Peregrine Falcons rose up from the hills and circled the team as well. As the day went on and the temperature rose, some nice thermals began to form. Red-tailed Hawks, including some beautiful dark-morphs, Red-shouldered Hawks, and Turkey Vultures all took advantage of the heat and formed great kettles for the team to look at. It was also a great day for Northern Harriers, and there was one sighting of a juvenile and an adult male hanging out together low over the hills. Two of our tagged Turkey Vultures were also spotted sunning themselves on a nearby rock.  Overall, it was a great day for Hawkwatching!&lt;br/&gt;

We were haunted by Gray Ghosts, and dark-morph raptors dominated the skies, including an adult Rough-legged Hawk, a few Red-tailed Hawks and even a Swainson's Hawk. A brilliant Red-shouldered Hawk cast its heavenly glow upon us before we descended back into the shadows of small Sharp-shinned Hawks and Turkey Vultures. Peregrine Falcons cackled eerily around us. While the raptors were clearly trying to TRICK us with their befuddling field marks, it was a real TREAT to watch these special birds. Happy Hawk-o-ween!&lt;br/&gt;

A fabulous day with sightings of Peregrine Falcons swooping on Red-tailed Hawks and Northern Harriers. Two Rough-legged Hawks came into view this morning as well, one a juvenile and another an adult. Early in the afternoon our team also had the amazing luck of seeing 5 eagles - 2 Golden Eagles and 3 Bald Eagles! Even our Red-tailed Hawk sightings today felt special, with good views of some beautiful dark-morph birds and two others doing a display flight over Kirby Cove. In non-raptor news, we also watched about a hundred Brant geese fly by the Hill today, in addition to the usual massive flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons that circle the Hill often these days. All things considered, a phenomenal day for Tuesday 2 Hawkwatch!&lt;br/&gt;

In the first couple hours of counting, we saw mostly Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks but were excited when a few Red-shouldered Hawks appeared around the Hill. Midday, the wind picked up slightly and the team got good looks at a variety of Northern Harriers including an adult male, an adult female, and a juvenile hunting in the hills of the Headlands below Hawkwatch. An early afternoon Ferruginous Hawk made an appearance, spiraling upward in front of the Golden Gate Bridge before heading south toward San Francisco. Not an hour later, a second FEHA was spotted in the west, over 2 miles away! The final (falcon) hour included visits from a speeding Merlin, a fluttering male and female Kestrel, and a zooming Peregrine falcon &#150; a fast and furious end to a slow-starting day.&lt;br/&gt;

Due to the surprisingly late season fog, the morning was spent birding around the lagoon where the team saw some Yellowthroats, American Wigeons, a Hermit Thrush, and a Merlin. A group of river otters was also spotted hanging out in the water! Conditions seemed to be improving around mid-morning, but the fog kept coming and refused to leave the headlands. As the team left, a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk came through the fog wall and flew close overhead as if to say goodbye. We hope that this is the last foggy day of the season, and look forward to some actual hawk counting next time!&lt;br/&gt;

Our day started off foggy but cleared early on and allowed for a full day of counting. One of our most unusual sightings was a flock of 30 Canada Geese that flew high overhead in a classic arrow formation. Today was a great day for Northern Harriers; we spotted juveniles and adult males in every hour of the day, with some coming close enough to admire their facial disks and the shocking gray plumage of the adult males, colloquially called &#147;Gray Ghosts.&#148; We also had two beautiful White-tailed Kites fly by, slow enough for us to marvel at their bright white, unique plumage. One of the juvenile Red-tailed Hawks that was color-banded through the GGRO banding program stilled for a few minutes in front of the hill, making it possible to take a picture and read the number off the band. We are looking forward to finding out the day the bird was banded!&lt;br/&gt;

We had great sightings of two Osprey, Red-shouldered Hawks, and some Peregrine Falcons and Merlins. A few of our team members debated the possibility of identifying one Merlin as a Prairie Merlin (Falco columbarius richardsonii), a subspecies of Merlin that breeds in the prairies of Saskatchewan and Montana. This particular bird looked light in color and had strikingly thick, light tail bands, which is characteristic of the subspecies.  We saw quite a few Accipiters and a good number of them were adults. A great day at the hill, and we are hoping to have fair weather again next time. &lt;br/&gt;

Adult and juvenile Accipiters alike flew closely over the Hill, giving the team a great opportunity to appreciate differences in plumage. An Osprey popped up directly under the noses of the Hawkwatchers in the western quadrant close enough that we could see the white scalloping on the back feathers, indicating that it was a juvenile bird. Towards the end of the day we had a large influx of Merlins, which skyrocketed past the in groups of 2 and 3. A great day of Hawkwatching, and we are excited for more to come on Hawk Hill!&lt;br/&gt;

Overall, there was not a huge flight of birds, but activity picked up in the afternoon and we had a nice diversity of species. A White-tailed Kite flew directly over Hawk Hill, allowing all of us to admire it. Early on in our day, an adult Peregrine Falcon rose up from the hills below, close enough to see individual feathers and startle some of our Hawkwatchers. In the afternoon, we were distracted by a far-off Ferruginous Hawk when a kettle of Red-tailed Hawks seemingly appeared out of nowhere on the other side of the Hill. Our day was completed by an afternoon Merlin hunting a butterfly. After three unsuccessful attempts, the Merlin flew off and the butterfly carried on. We're wishing both individuals a successful migration moving forward. Tuesday II is hoping for more clear days on Hawk Hill! &lt;br/&gt;

The morning began with many Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, and Cooper's Hawks flying far off in the distance. As the day went on and the Headlands warmed up, more birds started flying closer overhead, including American Kestrels, Merlins, and a beautiful juvenile dark morph Red-tail. Later in the afternoon, the first Rough-legged Hawk of the season made an appearance flying low and close near Hawk Hill! The team got a great look at it before it flew off through the Headlands and towards the south. The day wrapped up with a fun look at an adult Red-tail perched on a rock just a couple yards away from Hawk Hill eating some freshly caught prey before it was chased off by some of the local ravens. Overall, it was a great day for Sunday 2 and we're excited to have seen the first Roughie of the 2018 season! &lt;br/&gt;

However, in a briefly clear window near noon, our team managed to spot plenty of Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, and both adult and juvenile Accipiters. A couple of Harriers and small Falcons also flew over in that same timeframe. Shortly thereafter, sadly, the wind picked back up and the fog surged back over the Hill closing our count down early. Though today wasn't nearly as busy as the last Saturday II, we are hopeful for more good days down the road! &lt;br/&gt;

Clear skies greeted the team as we made our way up the Hill, but a layer of fog soon threatened to roll in off the ocean. Fortunately, shifting winds kept the fog largely away from us, giving us a chance to look at a good number of raptors. The star bird of the day was an incredible light-colored Harlan's Hawk that spent several minutes right above the heads of the Hawkwatchers! Other highlights included several adult Accipiters, close-flying American Kestrels, and all three subspecies of Merlin. All told, a very rewarding first day on the Hill for Tuesday 2! &lt;br/&gt;

The morning started off with some good views of adult Accipiters as well as Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, and a fast-moving Merlin. Things picked up midday when we spotted three White-tailed Kites as well as a sub-adult Bald Eagle flying just south of the hill (special thanks to an observant visitor for pointing it out!). We were also treated to a delightful view of an adult Red-shouldered Hawk circling the hills. Later in the afternoon the team got an excellent look at two juvenile Ferruginous Hawks cruising lazily around the Headlands. Overall, it was another great day for Sunday 1! &lt;br/&gt;

However, we did get to watch a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk be released at the noon Hawk Talk and Raptor Release.  Despite the inclement weather and poor visibility, we were excited to celebrate World Migratory Bird Day with our team and this special hawk guest.

Today was a great day for Friday I, with sunny and clear skies that were filled with raptors. An adult Ferruginous Hawk flew low in front of the Golden Gate Bridge, giving us the chance to marvel at its rufous markings on its back and white underside. We also had a close sighting of a beautiful Peregrine Falcon hunting in the hills in front of us. The Peregrine sported a light gray back and a sandy brown tail and nearly resembled a Prairie Falcon. Considering these field marks, the bird was likely a juvenile Arctic Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus tundrius), a subspecies that nests in the tundra of Alaska and Northern Canada. We were lucky to have some cool non-raptorial species visit us on the hill as well, including a Rock Wren, hundreds of Violet-green Swallows, some Vaux's and White-throated Swifts, and two humpback whales out in ocean. We left the hill feeling very lucky, and a little sun-burnt from such a beautiful day!  &lt;br/&gt;

The morning started off with an excellent look at a juvenile Broad-winged Hawk flying around next to an American Crow. Soon after, we started seeing Red-shouldered Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, American Kestrels, Cooper's Hawks, and Sharp-shinned Hawks soaring around the hill. The team got a good look at an adult Peregrine Falcon soaring overhead as well. As the weather got warmer, we had high kettles directly above Hawk Hill filled with a variety of different raptors, including a juvenile Swainson's Hawk! The day concluded with a close-up look at a Merlin as it circled the team before flying off to chase down some prey. Overall, it was a wonderful day for Thursday 1!&lt;br/&gt;

We also had a late morning sighting of a vagrant Palm Warbler, which continued to make appearances around Hawk Hill throughout the rest of the day.

We were able to count for an hour before suspending our count and ultimately leaving the Hill early. On the bright side, we were able to get great looks at the field marks on the 20 birds we counted because they were so close to the Hill! (Any other farther-flying birds were invisible to us.) However, the wind and fog were worth enduring as we were joined by the GGRO's wonderful director, Allen Fish, who also happened to be celebrating his birthday today. Happy birthday, Allen!

Beautiful clear skies and a nice breeze made for great Hawkwatching conditions, and the team had a fun challenge when multiple kettles of hawks started popping up in all directions. Groups of Cooper's Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, Red-shouldered Hawks, and Broad-winged Hawks circled high above Hawk Hill, taking advantage of the thermals forming from the warm weather. Turkey Vultures, including our tagged friend #368, also took advantage of the heat and soared around the Headlands. We also saw plenty of falcons &#150; Kestrels, Merlins, and Peregrines were all spotted flying quickly overhead. The team also got great looks at some White-tailed Kites and Northern Harriers. Overall, Saturday II had an awesome day with the highest count of the season so far!&lt;br/&gt;

It was our first time getting an entire day out there, and our team was thrilled. We had a lot of close looks at a lot of great species, including a Broad-winged Hawk circling right above the hill and accompanied by an Osprey. A Merlin flew by close above us just minutes after we got up on the hill, and later in the afternoon an adult Red-tailed Hawk cried out its classic alarm call before stooping dramatically into Kirby Cove at an unseen threat. The raptors were not the only ones with impressive flight displays today, as the skies were also peppered with jets throughout the day who were practicing for this weekend's air shows, including the Blue Angels. &lt;br/&gt;A special thanks to the group of awesome volunteers who came out today to bulk up our team, considering it was especially small today! We appreciated the extra help and are very grateful. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

However, a westerly wind picked up in the late morning and the raptors began appearing around Hawk Hill. Highlights of the day included an adult Red-shouldered Hawk diving on a juvenile Northern Harrier, a pair of adult Peregrine Falcons hunting on the Slacker Ridge, and a male American Kestrel flying directly over the Hawkwatching team. An exciting 10-species day for the team! &lt;br/&gt;

It was humid with little wind, and not a lot of hawks. We still were able to see a Grey Ghost, a sub-adult Bald Eagle and an adult Peregrine! Towards the end the wind picked up and the raptors started to stream by. Happy to finally get out for longer than 2 hours. We hope the weather will continue to improve for our team and that we will have a full day next time. &lt;br/&gt;

The group was greeted by sunlight and visitors from the Mendocino Coast Audubon Society. A male Northern Harrier (&#147;grey ghost&#148;) was the first raptor to appear, soon followed by a steady stream of Accipiters and Red-tailed Hawks that continued throughout the day. Mid-morning, the team observed a couple Broad-winged Hawks kettling with other Buteos and Turkey Vultures in the distance. Shortly after that, a far Ferruginous Hawk sighting and a nearly vertical stoop from a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk drew excitement from the assembled Hawkwatchers. The day concluded with two Merlins in the sky (one nearly over the Hawkwatcher platform on Hawk Hill) and a total of 12 observed species.&lt;br/&gt;

Highlights included several adult male Northern Harriers, a far-off Bald-Eagle, and a very nice up-close view of a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk that flew right over the team! Several other hawks, especially Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks, were flying high overhead today (and were at one point joined by a high-up Peregrine Falcon). While today's weather was pleasant for the Hawkwatch team, we are hoping for more hawk-friendly winds in days to come! &lt;br/&gt;

Thankfully, the weather stayed mild throughout the day, allowing us to get good looks at American Kestrels, Red-tailed Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, and Cooper's Hawks. Early on in the day we also had some close looks at a pair of adult Peregrines and a White-tailed Kite hanging around the hill. Distant Red-shouldered Hawks and Broad-winged Hawks also made an appearance. The day ended with a couple of harriers including some beautiful adult males and an Osprey. We also had some non-raptor highlights today. A Band-tail Pigeon hung out on the railing during our noon Hawk Talk and a lovely proposal happened with a gorgeous view of the Golden Gate Bridge in the background.

This year, we have begun a new side project in partnership with Golden Gate Cetacean Research. Although we only record data when we observe whales in and around the San Francisco Bay, today we got a great look at a Steller Sea Lion enjoying a fish while being mobbed by gulls. It was great to see such a large marine mammal swimming below the raptors at Hawk Hill! &lt;br/&gt;

At the time, with good winds and lifting fog, all seemed like a promising day for migration. Sadly, less than an hour later, our familiar companion, The Fog, returned to the Headlands and swallowed our chances of seeing any more birds. With visibility worsening by the minute, we officially suspended our count early, and are hoping for better Tuesday 1's (and other days) in the future. (A quick disclaimer &#150; though we had a great 40 minutes counting hawks today, the short timing of our count means that our reported Raptors per Hour for the day is quite high&#133;)&lt;br/&gt;

A bunch of Broad-winged Hawks, including a few late afternoon adults, were early visitors to Hawk Hill. The Broad-wings were often joined by Red-shouldered Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, and Northern Harriers, forming large kettles in front of the Golden Gate Bridge and Slacker Ridge. In addition to Buteos, the Hawkwatchers were frequently following falcons &#150; American Kestrels, Merlins, and a mid-morning Peregrine to be exact. The migrating Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks continued to make appearances throughout the day (including an adult or two). Turkey Vultures and an Osprey capped the species count at 11. What started as a beautiful, sunny day ended at 3pm when the fog rolled back in.&lt;br/&gt;

In addition to the many Accipiters we saw in flight today we were fortunate to see many Broad-winged Hawks from the Hill, including some adults, as well as a good number of Merlins and our first Bald Eagle of the season!

We also saw Red-tails and Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks hunting in the fields. Hopefully the fog lifts soon and the team can get back to proper hawk counting next time!&lt;br/&gt;

We packed up our spotting scopes and binoculars and retreated down to Conzelman Road to attempt to wait out the fog, and yet it did not lift. Although we had to leave the hill early, we were able to get in one productive hour. Hopefully the gloomy weather will clear for tomorrow's team!&lt;br/&gt;

Our patience with the fog was rewarded with two late afternoon Ferruginous Hawks, with one coming especially close to the Hill. The day wrapped up with some adult Red-tails hunting directly over us, making us feel less like the Hawkwatchers and more like the Hawkwatch-ees!

The team was still able to get some good looks at Red-tailed, Sharp-shinned, and Cooper's Hawks, with some flying right over the hill in front of us. There was also a great sighting of a Merlin that flew low overhead before disappearing into the clouds. Later in the day, we had a clear view of some Broad-winged Hawks and an Osprey over the water. A Humpback Whale was also seen from the hill, and the team had fun watching it smack the water with its fluke before diving down and swimming away. &lt;br/&gt;

As we left the hill, a juvenile Sharp-shinned flew low over all our heads and gave us a great look at it, almost as if it were saying goodbye. Until next time, sweet sharpies!&lt;br/&gt;

The count began with many of our often-seen species like Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures. However, as the day continued, we began to see more diversity and greater numbers. Sharp-shinned Hawks and Cooper's Hawks rode along the Slacker ridgeline from noon onwards. A sub-adult Golden Eagle flew around Hawk Hill toward San Francisco, giving the team time to look at feather molt and determine the age of the bird. Northern Harriers flew in rocking dihedrals down in the valleys around the counting platforms. By the end of the day, the team had also welcomed three new species to this seasons' count: a distant dark morph Swainson's Hawk, a fast-moving Merlin, and a soaring adult Ferruginous Hawk. &lt;br/&gt;

However, the team still had a good time birding on the beach and around the lagoon, seeing Western Sandpipers, a Pectoral Sandpiper, Marbled Godwits, and Red-necked Phalaropes. We also saw some Wilson's Warblers, Pacific-slope Flycatchers, Rough-winged Swallows, and Golden-crowned Sparrows. The team also got a great look at a low flying tagged Turkey Vulture, #372! Overall, the team had a fun time hanging out and are hoping for clear skies for next Wednesday 2. &lt;br/&gt;

Despite this continued adversity, we birded around the Headlands in the hope that the fog would later lift (sadly, it did not). We did see a few Townsend's Warblers to brighten our day, however, and got some looks at intermediate- and dark-morph Red-tailed Hawks as well. Hoping the fog comes to an end soon, since we want to see more raptors - as well as our shadows. &lt;br/&gt;

Two different tagged Turkey Vultures visited the hill multiple times today, so to future teams: bring your zoom lenses!

We got up onto Hawk Hill by noon and spent the afternoon counting.

We got a good look at a far away Peregrine Juvenile interacting with a Red-tailed juvenile, which made for great discussion and comparison. Thanks to some keen eyes we spotted two Kestrels in the last half hour of the day, as well as a tagged Turkey Vulture, whose number we were unable to read. We're all looking forward to reconvening on the hill, as a small but mighty team! &lt;br/&gt;

We saw many Red-tails hunting over the hills, allowing us to get some practice aging them. We also caught glimpses of American Kestrels, Cooper's Hawks, and an Osprey throughout the day. There was much excitement mid-day when a group of Turkey Vultures flew right over the hill and we noticed one had a wing-tag. Everyone scrambled to get a good look at it, and together we were able to read its number - #368! Another highlight of the day was when an adult Peregrine Falcon zoomed around the hill, allowing everyone to get a nice long look at it. Overall, it was a wonderful first day and we are hopeful for more days like today. &lt;br/&gt;

The hill was clear this morning, so we all hustled into our cars to start hawkwatching as quickly as we could. The fog came in and out intermittently in the morning with few birds in the sky, but as the day went on it stayed clear for us and we started seeing some cool birds. Multiple groups of Rough-winged Swallows and Band-tailed Pigeons flew by the hill, and we saw harbor porpoises and a humpback whale spouting in front of the bridge. We saw five raptor species in total, with one juvenile Cooper's Hawk that showed up in the last five minutes of the day making the only Accipiter of the day. We're all looking forward to reconvening on the hill in September.&lt;br/&gt;

Hopefully, next week will bring clearer weather and additional interesting birds to see!&lt;br/&gt;

However, the group still had a good time birding around the nearby lagoon, seeing seabirds such as Brown Pelicans, Double-crested Cormorants, and Western Gulls. We also spotted some Blue-gray Gnatcatchers and a Cedar Waxwing in the nearby bushes! Later, we moved over to a mowed field and got some great views of foraging passerines such as House Finches, Western Bluebirds, White-crowned Sparrows, and Spotted Towhees. There was also a great moment where we saw an American Kestrel angrily dive at a Red-tailed Hawk that was hanging out in a tree. Despite the poor weather conditions that prevented us from getting up the hill, Sunday 1 still had a fun morning birding!&lt;br/&gt;

The morning started off well; minutes after we got settled in our quadrants an Osprey appeared straight overhead. We continued having a steady stream of sightings throughout the day, with a handful of juvenile Red-tailed Hawks every hour plus others. We even caught sight of a Turkey Vulture that was tagged for our Project Zopilote! The vulture appeared a few times right below us and even though the bright blue patagial tags are large with three printed numbers, we all struggled to get a good view of the number. However, passing the tagged vulture between quadrants was a great team-building experience for us and added some excitement to our pre-peak day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We would definitely recommend other Hawkwatchers who have cameras with good zoom capability to bring them out, not only to take pictures of the beautiful migrants we see, but also to take pictures of tagged vultures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

We were lucky to have seen Peregrine Falcons, Northern Harrier and a small group of Purple Martins while on the Hill. Our team got a lot of practice identifying Red-tailed Hawks as many decided to hover overhead for long periods of time. An adult Accipiter flew overhead, helping to shake off the off-season rust of having to differentiate Cooper's Hawks from Sharp-shinned Hawks. In the end it was an adult Cooper's Hawk. A great first day on Hawk Hill, and an excited look to what the season will bring!&lt;br/&gt;

This season, Hawkwatch is thrilled to have so many wonderful volunteers returning and proud to be joined by 28 new apprentices. &lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the season started with a fogged-out day. However, the Monday 1 team managed to make the best of it by taking a Raptor ID quiz and watching flight videos. These educational moments were designed to help train new Hawkwatchers as well as to refresh raptor identification to everyone in the program. The team put their skills to the test, identifying a Red-tailed Hawk and Turkey Vultures down by the Lagoon later in the morning.&lt;br/&gt;Overall, it's exciting to have everyone back for the fall migration. Best of luck to the rest of the teams this week!&lt;br/&gt;
