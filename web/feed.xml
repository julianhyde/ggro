While waiting, we got a great look at an adult Red-tailed Hawk perched in a tree. As the fog began to burn off, we ventured up the hill to find sunny skies and no wind. Throughout the day, the wind never picked up and temperatures remained in the mid-70s to low-80s. Wind direction predominated from the east, but changed occasionally to the south. These unfavorable weather conditions limited the number of hawks we observed. While we mostly saw Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks, we were excited to see a Ferruginous Hawk after a weekend lacking these majestic raptors. Other notable sightings were several Peregrine Falcons and a perched Merlin.&lt;br/&gt;

Temperatures danced around the 60s and wind speeds varied from O to 10mph.  The fog threatened to shut down the count on more than one occasion, but the Hawkwatchers remained positive in moments of zero visibility.  Though Accipiter counts were low, there was an equal amount of adults and juveniles seen.    &lt;br/&gt;

We had moderate numbers with eight species for most of the day until the last two hours, when two White-tailed Kites, a Peregrine Falcon and a male American Kestrel appeared in the north quadrant. Red-tailed Hawks were the heavy hitters of the day, with 142 sightings, including a beautiful, very light juvenile male who gave a lovely show during the banding demo. The light markings on his back and some black breast feathers led Hawkwatchers to discuss whether he might just be an intergrade between a typical Red-tailed Hawk and a Harlan's Hawk, a Red-tailed Hawk subspecies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HARLAN'S HISTORY: Formerly considered a separate species, the Harlan's Hawk was reclassified in 1973 as a subspecies of the Red-tailed Hawk. It is characterized by a lack of rufous coloration and more black feathers on the upperparts, as well as barring on the outer primaries in juveniles. There is a stable zone of intergrade between Harlan's Hawks and typical western Red-tailed Hawks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Unfortunately we weren't able to spot this Eurasian species, but we did see some visiting fall ducks and had a nice walk before heading up to check out the visibility up top. Fog still shrouded the peak of Hawk Hill so we spent some time waiting at the Annex by the roundabout, where we were able to spot some raptors down in Kirby Cove and along Slacker Ridge. As soon as the hill cleared at a quarter to one we were on our way, and managed to spot seven species of raptors during the official count time. Highlights included a few Northern Harriers, zooming Merlins, and a lovely adult Red-shouldered Hawk. &lt;br/&gt;

While raptor activity overall was relatively low, we spotted 122 Red-tailed Hawks, second in numbers only to Turkey Vultures, as usual. Two dark-morph adult Red-tails were spotted in the afternoon. We were shocked and dismayed when the &#147;daily Ferrug&#148; failed to appear, and also missed the Golden Eagles that had been appearing often in the last week. We did get to see an Osprey and a White-tailed Kite, species that were a little more common earlier in the season but hadn't been seen as often lately. We were entertained by the appearance of a Raven with two large feathers sticking out at odd angles; this bird could clearly use some practice in proper preening technique. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AND NOW, THE WEATHER: Today was sunny with only a few clouds, but hazy in the distance over the city. The haze and strong light made visibility poor when viewing far-off birds. Wind began in the northeast and east and shifted later in the day towards the west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Our first sighting of the day was a Merlin that ushered in a pleasant flow of birds, bringing us to about 100 raptors per hour from 11 am to 1 pm. A fairly high number of Red-shouldered Hawks (11 in total) showed off their crescents for us, while our life blood&#151;Red-tailed Hawks&#151;kept us busy throughout. Not to be forgotten, our &#147;daily Ferruginous Hawk&#148; arrived between 2 and 3 for the requisite admiration of the Hawkwatch.&lt;br/&gt;

The day began with a case of déjà vu&#133; A familiar looking raptor appeared over Slacker Ridge and the Hawkwatchers took notice. What initially appeared to be a strange Red-tailed Hawk was later recognized as a dark morph Swainson's Hawk. Perhaps, this was the same individual spotted on yesterday's watch. In the afternoon, a distant Golden Eagle was spotted in the North Saddle. While there was much debate over the age when looking through scopes, a photograph taken by one of our Hawkwatchers cleared up the matter. This individual showed both juvenile and adult feathers, indicating a second-year bird beginning its long transition into adult plumage. Along with these interesting sightings, we also observed the daily Ferruginous Hawk, the Golden Gate Bridge Peregrine Falcon and four American Kestrels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today's Weather Report: Temperatures slowly increased from the high-60s to the mid-70s around noon. A shift from eastern to western winds cooled us down in the afternoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fun Fact: The opposite of déjà vu is jamais vu, or the sensation of having never seen a familiar word before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

A total of 23 Merlins were spotted today as they zipped by the Hill, moving south in a hurry! The day started slowly, with winds from the south and east, bringing some interesting birds into south quadrant (but not much elsewhere). Temperatures ranged in the comfortable high 60s and low 70s throughout the day. Around noon, the wind shifted to the southwest and, surprisingly, numbers began to pick up and a slew of uncommon and unique birds flew by the Hill. Our daily Ferruginous Hawk appeared around this time, continuing the surprising streak of sightings throughout the season. Hawkwatchers applied the weekly intern presentation on aging Golden Eagles to not one, but two, Golden Eagles that were seen today! As the 2:00 hour began, everything became a blur as the sky filled with falcons and Red-tailed Hawks. As two Peregrine Falcons locked talons, a leucistic adult Red-tailed Hawk soared above. This bird had completely white upperwing coverts, while the flight feathers and tail showed normal plumage. A bird that first appeared to be a dark-morph Red-tailed Hawk was then discovered to be a dark-morph Swainson's Hawk, one of only a few this season. The day ended with the glorious release of our second telemetry bird this year, a male juvenile Red-tailed Hawk dubbed "Gypsy". We look forward to following Gypsy's travels for the next week or so and wish him luck! You too can follow his flights at www.ggrotelemetry.blogspot.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Turkey Vultures, Red-tailed Hawks, and swirling winds!  White-tailed Kites, Peregrine Falcons, and Golden Eagles!  Not to deviate from the current trend, a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk flew by in the afternoon.  A Peregrine Falcon also gave the Hawkwatchers a good show, repeatedly stooping on a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk.   Adding to the drama, a small plane practically skimmed the platform in the morning and in the afternoon two drones appeared high in the skies, including one that fell and crashed into the hillside. &lt;br/&gt;

We had just enough time to count several representatives of our common species and two Northern Harriers. Unfortunately, a dense fog rolled in at 12:30, prompting us to leave the Turkey Vulture tally for another day. Hawkwatchers enjoyed watching the banding demo, given by docent Randy Breaux, before heading off the Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GULL GUFFAW: Why don't you see seagulls flying over the Bay? Because then, they would be Bay-Gulls!&lt;br/&gt;

We saw weather appropriate for seemingly every month of the migration, from late summer to early winter. One minute, raptors were flying, while the next minute, we were covered in fog (and even a few stray raindrops)! Highlights of the day included two Ferruginous Hawks and a very pale-headed Red-tailed Hawk that made some of our Hawkwatchers do a double-take. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAPTOR RHYMES: The weather today was confusing, but not as frigid as the snow storm described in the hawk-inspired poem below.

It was an overall pleasant day with increasing sightings of adult Accipiters and another great look at a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk that did a slow pass past the platform before heading to The City.  There was an interesting sighting of a dark morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawk that was very light colored on the dorsal side.  A juvenile Northern Harrier provided a nice send-off to the Hawkwatchers, popping up just below Fish Rock during the final minutes of the count.  &lt;br/&gt;

Yet this did not inhibit Hawkwatchers from seeing some wonderful raptors. The first half-hour only had five sightings, but an adult Peregrine Falcon and a juvenile Northern Harrier gave us hope for improvement. That hope was met (and exceeded) when Natasha spotted a large, dark, non-Red-tailed Hawk&#133;.wait! It's a dark morph Ferruginous Hawk! Many agreed that this could be the best bird of the season, and all were satisfied when it gave us a lingering close-up before heading towards the Bridge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DARK MORPH DATUM: Of the species seen at Hawk Hill, all of the Buteos except for Red-shouldered Hawks show multiple color morphs, but only three percent are dark morphs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Yet, our songbird count reached 176.3 individuals per hour as large flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons and Violet-green Swallows swarmed around the hill.  Though the raptor hourly counts were low, a large variety of species were seen. This made the heat a little more bearable. During the second hour of the day, nine species were counted including a late-season Osprey and the two Golden Gate Bridge dwelling Peregrine Falcons. Along with these two species, ten juvenile Northern Harriers flew through the north quadrant throughout the day. Here's hoping for more wind and more raptors tomorrow. &lt;br/&gt;

Our dependable flow of Red-tailed Hawks, Sharp-shinned Hawks, and Cooper's Hawks came with a consistent Northwest wind that kicked up mid-morning. Later in the afternoon, warmer temperatures generated thermals for large kettles of Turkey Vultures. We may have seen many juvenile Ferruginous Hawks in the past few weeks, but few sightings have been as spectacular as today's individual, who circumnavigated the entire Hawk Hill summit!  An adult female Northern Harrier also visited the Hill, illustrating complex hunting patterns. &lt;br/&gt;

The morning started with dense fog, but it rolled out for great visibility in the afternoon. We started our count off right with close-up views of a White-tailed Kite and a Broad-winged Hawk, both displaying their classic field marks. Our trusty Red-tailed Hawks and Accipiters ruled the day thereafter, and Hawkwatchers got in some field entomology practice, spotting approximately 40 butterflies. We also enjoyed a visit from young UC Santa Cruz ornithologists and several Audubon groups. Once the Blue Angels got going, we had several seemingly surprised birds fleeing the scene and (happily) increasing our total species numbers, including a Merlin and an Osprey!&lt;br/&gt;

Fleet Week festivities kept the south quadrant interesting as the parade of ships passed under the bridge in the morning, and a pair of gray whales could be seen feeding in the middle of the lineup. Two adult Peregrine Falcons and one juvenile sped by the south platform, reminding everyone that there were birds to be counted too. Lots of Accipiters kept the Hawkwatchers on their toes, as did several raptor ID studies from the banders at Hawk Blind. Large kettles of Red-shouldered Hawks tested everyone's scope skills from the far north, and our daily dose of Ferruginous Hawk appeared right in front of our eyes as we were working the distant birds. The afternoon concluded with the Blue Angels jets flying close enough overhead to wave to the pilots, and the team left slightly sunburned but in good spirits. &lt;br/&gt;

Raptor activity overall was low, but two pairs of adult Peregrine Falcons,  two Ferruginous Hawks, and eight juvenile Northern Harriers kept us glued to the sky. The lack of activity may have been related to the still air and warm temperatures felt in the morning, but things picked up later in the day. The peak for adult Accipiters may be approaching, as both Sharp-shinned Hawk and Cooper's Hawk adults were spotted in proportions much higher than before. A nocturnal raptor species seen today was a Great Horned Owl, oddly enough, perched on a telephone pole in the South Quadrant at 3 PM.

The hawks were flying and giving great views with a nice midday peak of Sharp-shinned Hawks and Red-shouldered Hawks, including a few adults thrown in the mix.  The highest species diversity and count occurred during the 12 o'clock hour, including a distant White-tailed Kite, a few Merlins, and the trusty Golden Gate Bridge adult Peregrine.  We had a lovely visit from the kindergarteners of Marin Horizon School, whose teacher, Kathleen Hazelton-Leech, has been bringing her &#147;Red-tailed Hawks&#148; for a visit on the Hill for 30 years. Thanks for coming out to visit the hawks!&lt;br/&gt;

Two Golden Eagles! After two cycles of extreme weather, almost 100 degree heat and cold winds, Tuesday II finally had excellent hawk watching weather which brought in some terrific raptors. The close head-on view of a Broad-winged Hawk kicked off the day's excitement. Around noon, the cry of &#147;Ferruuugg!&#148; could be heard across the platform. Everyone turned to the north to see a Ferruginous Hawk hovering nearby. However, the real excitement occurred when two juvenile Golden Eagles were spotted over Angel Island. What an excellent way to celebrate Pat's four score birthday and Molly and Nick's last days on Hawkwatch. Happy Birthday (UNHHH)!&lt;br/&gt;

After two cycles of extremely hot weather, the Monday II Team was grateful for pleasant winds and a moderate temperature. We were joined by another Audubon birdwatching group eager to observe the migration and spot some unique hawks. They were rewarded with the sight of a few juvenile Broad-winged Hawks, one of which was a dark morph. Later in the day, we also were haunted by a &#147;Gray Ghost&#148;, an adult male Northern Harrier, followed by an amazing head-on view of a Ferruginous Hawk. The Hawaiian Chieftain, a gorgeous tall ship, heralded the end of the day with cannon fire as she entered the bay.&lt;br/&gt;

Accipiters were flying left and right and Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures accumulated in massive kettles throughout the day. Throw in some Merlins and Broad-winged Hawks and we had ourselves a raptor party. As the wind increased into the afternoon, our unidentified Accipiter count increased as well. Along with great sightings of hawks, many visitors came to the hill throughout the day. We had an excellent group of inquisitive guests at our Hawk Talk and Banding Demonstration.

The morning started off slowly, with thin fog moving in and out of the Headlands and obscuring most of the birds. The day ended with winds strong enough to blow over the strongest of Hawkwatchers! Nevertheless, we had a strong finish with over 500 raptors counted in what was really a 3 hour (rather than a true 6 hour) day. The falcon game was intense today, with multiple overhead views of Merlins and Peregrine Falcons. We even got to practice &#147;birding by the tail&#148; with several male American Kestrels. We continued to build on a larger-than-average year for Ferruginous Hawks, with three close-up sightings. Glad we got off Hawk Hill before we started losing volunteers to the wind. Thanks Saturday I and see you in two weeks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TAIL TALES: For many raptors, the outer tail feathers, technically called the 6th retrices, are a different size or color than the rest of the tail feathers. One excellent example from today on the Hill was the male American Kestrel, whose 6th retrices are white with black spots, in contrast to the rest of the tail (mostly rufous, with a large black subterminal band and a white terminal band). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Early in the morning as the count began, Hawkwatchers were treated to the sight of a Short-eared Owl that flew close enough to see clearly without binoculars right by the West and North quadrants. This excitement was followed by a steady flow of Accipiters, Red-shouldered Hawks, and Broad-winged Hawks, the latter of which provided some great views as they formed a kettle right overhead in the fifth quadrant. Fair weather brought past and present Hawkwatchers and their friends from all teams to the Hill today, crowding the North and East quadrants with scopes and hundreds of cumulative years of Hawkwatching experience. The South and West quadrants didn't feel left out, as they were entertained by humpback whales feeding and spouting off of Point Bonita.&lt;br/&gt;

The pace of activity seemed evenly spread today, with raptors graciously timing their migration to suit our identification needs! We had three glorious looks at Ferruginous Hawks, all showing off their three points of light (tail and wing windows). Northern Harriers charmed us with four chances to check out their white rump patches and pumpkin orange bellies. It was also a decent Merlin day, with four swift looks that were made better by occurring almost directly overhead. We were joined by a new team member, Caryl Carr, and got the news that our wonderful Christine Lamphear will be leaving us for new beginnings in Reno, NV. We wish her the best of luck, and welcome the very experienced Caryl to the team! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROAD-WING BROADCAST: We would be remiss if we didn't mention our excellent, close-up views of Broad-winged Hawks today on the Hill. Broad-wings are eastern migrants that, for many years, were not believed to occur in California. We've catalogued their travels over Hawk Hill for an average of about 200 sightings per season. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Monday I seems to have a weather curse, as we were fogged out last cycle and 3 of our 4 days so far have been foggy! We did get a nice look at a Kestrel perched in a tree as well as some Accipiter action. Once on the Hill the fog hung close by and didn't clear until the very last hour of the day. Despite this, we were still able to see 381 raptors representing 10 different species. The special bird of the day was a dark-morph juvenile Broad-winged Hawk that flew by several times. We also had some nice looks at Merlins and juvenile Northern Harriers (pumpkin spice season is starting, after all!). At the end of the day we were treated to a pair of Peregrine Falcons chasing Ravens and showing off some spectacular stoops. While the weather was cold and windy and the HPH was lower than it has been of late, we still had a nice day and enjoyed watching the raptors we could see through the fog.&lt;br/&gt;

Lagoon sightings included: three river otters, Greater Yellowlegs, Eared Grebes, and a daring deer that walked through the middle of the lagoon.  Once we got onto the Hill around 11, activity picked up with flurries of accipiters, kettles of Broad-winged Hawks, and crowds of excited birders on the platform hoping to catch a glimpse.  The highlight of the day was the five Merlin sightings in one half hour.  We retreated at the day as the wind and fog continued to persist; hopefully it clears for the Super/Blood/Harvest Moon eclipse tonight! &lt;br/&gt;

Mercifully, the weather improved significantly and cleared completely by noon, making for a great day of Hawkwatch. Since this group has been fogged out twice, Hawkwatchers were thrown into peak and faired amazingly well, especially with those tough accipiter calls. Along with our excellent view of accipiters, we were lucky to see two Peregrine Falcons in the final hour; one diving on an unfortunate Sharp-shinned Hawk. And we were joined on the Hill by a posse of aspiring Hawkwatchers, all under age twelve. Their enthusiasm (and accurate birding) gave us hope for the future of GGRO. Look out for Eddie's forthcoming book of hawk photography and ID techniques, hitting stores in 2030. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FUN FERRUGINOUS FACT: In the past ten years, GGRO has counted an average of 23 Ferruginous Hawks per year. This year to date, we've already seen 16. Our data shows the peak Ferruginous Hawk day typically falls on September 27th, so we are hoping to have a far better than average year for this species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Volunteers were entertained as they shot from the West quadrant across the walkway, giving everyone a great view on their way into the city. Highlights of the day included a photo-shoot of a juvenile Ferruginous hawk, close passes by a Merlin, and an adrenaline-filled pursuit by a juvenile Northern Harrier by the banders at Hawk Blind. (The banders didn't get this one, but Hawkwatch got a great show!) Stray Broad-winged Hawks continued their southern migration, mixing into large kettles with Red-tailed Hawks and Red-shouldered Hawks for some Buteo identification practice. All in all a fun and busy blustery day! &lt;br/&gt;

The total number of raptors dropped from &gt;1000 to ~700.  Despite the decreased number of hawks we still had great looks at a few Ferruginous Hawks and a fair number of Broad-winged Hawks.

The hawks were flying fast and furious today up on the Hill.  The weather, for a change, was neither scorching nor freezing.  As the Hawkwatchers crested the platform in the morning, kettles of Broad-winged Hawks began rising from multiple directions, inciting a mad scramble to set up scopes, get on binos, and assemble in quadrants.  Both Accipiters were flying en masse, providing good identification practice for all. The quadrant system communication relays were tested as hawks flew every which way, including beautiful overhead views of a Merlin, adult and juvenile Broad-winged Hawks, a juvenile Peregrine Falcon, and many Red-shouldered Hawks. We also had a lovely, long look at a Prairie Falcon. But nothing could beat the luxurious flight of a Ferruginous Hawk (flashing its famed &#147;three points of light&#148; in the near-ideal viewing conditions) who, having enthralled the entire Hawkwatch, conjured a partner. Both of them flew onwards towards the Golden Gate, the Hawkwatch looking on in awe. Many thanks to the helpful guests who joined the team to keep our tally up to speed; we're happy to report that the data sheet looks the worse for wear!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NUTTY NUMBERS: Today was the third highest one-day count in GGRO's history, after September 25, 1999 (1,283 sightings; 206 HPH) and September 21, 1984 (2,833 sightings; 404 HPH)!&lt;br/&gt;

Though we didn't see many birds today, we saw a glorious whale.  While yesterday's heat drove in great diversity of species, today's cold and windy weather seemed to discourage raptors from flying. Some individuals braved the harsh conditions and were blown in circuits around the hill giving all quadrants a look. The few birds we had allowed Hawkwatchers to practice passing off raptors from one quadrant to the next and hone their identification skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whale, we are going to blow your mind with this cool whale fact:&lt;br/&gt;In 2011, Varvara, a Gray Whale, swam 14,000 miles from Russian to Mexico and broke the record for the longest mammalian migration.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To read more about Varvara, check out this link: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/150414-gray-whale-pacific-migration-endangered-ocean-animal-science/&lt;br/&gt;

Notable birds included two close-flying Ferruginous Hawks, a Golden Eagle, and almost 20 Broad-winged Hawks.

Non-raptor sightings included 487 Vaux's Swifts and 8 fighter jets performing aerial stunts over the Headlands. The great number and variety of raptors seen today made braving the high temperatures worth it, and Hawkwatchers were rewarded with a cool breeze at the end of the day. &lt;br/&gt;

Also flying in the sky were flurries of dragonflies and butterflies. Sadly, they didn't lure a Merlin into our viewshed.

Numbers of Sharp-shinned Hawks overcame those of Cooper's Hawks, though our two Accipiters are still neck-and-neck for the season. We saw a high number of Red-shouldered Hawks&#150;including two adults&#150;likely because of the still, warm conditions. Hawk watchers were ecstatic to see eight Broad-winged Hawks, two Ferruginous Hawks, and the first Swainson's Hawk of the season all in one day! With numbers like these, we're looking forward to more peak days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SWAINSON'S SECRET: Though we only see an average of six Swainson's Hawks per year at the GGRO, they are far more plentiful in flooded agricultural fields around Davis, CA, just an hour and a half's drive inland (depending on traffic!). But don't wait long to check &#145;em out&#150;they're headed to Argentina for the winter!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Hawkwatchers were kept on their toes identifying large numbers of Cooper's and Sharp-shinned Hawks, which were often flying in kettles containing both species. Perhaps the most exciting sightings of the day were several photo-worthy views of juvenile Broad-winged Hawks, giving the team our closest look of these little Buteos so far this season. Migration is definitely ramping up at Hawk Hill! &lt;br/&gt;

Nevertheless, our slow start failed to discourage us thanks to the cheering presence of dayleader Josh Haiman's new Siberian Husky puppy, Helena (so much CUTE!). Our Accipiter numbers have been building: today we saw 48 Sharp-shinned Hawks and 49 Cooper's Hawks. Other highlights of the day included the first eagle of the season, a juvenile Golden Eagle, which graced us with its presence in the final minutes of the count (it appeared on the scene over the FM towers at approximately 3:25 pm)! Below the Golden Eagle, Josh spotted the only Broad-winged of the day, making for an exciting end to the afternoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WING WITTICISM: Did you know that both airplane wings and boat sails are modeled after bird wings? The curve of the wing creates differential pressure above and below the wing (or sail), creating lift or forward movement. We enjoyed watching this principle come to life in the form of an intense regatta playing out below Hawk Hill.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Luckily, spirits were lifted shortly before this early end by a pair of whales displaying just west of the Golden Gate. Everyone got a look at the tail slapping in their scopes and binoculars, and whale-savvy Hawkwatchers determined them to be a mother and calf humpback whale pair. Despite the rain, the Wednesday 1 team left the hill with high spirits and plenty of practice differentiating Sharp-shinned Hawks from Cooper's Hawks.&lt;br/&gt;

We had a great time spotting many non-raptor species and three river otters in the Rodeo Valley Lagoon while waiting for the fog to clear. Ever hopeful, we hiked up to the Hill at noon and had a wonderful hour and a half of Hawkwatch and Outreach programs before being enveloped in the fog again. Even for such a short observation time, numbers of Sharp-shinned Hawks seem to finally be increasing! A juvenile Northern Harrier also gave us and the Hawk Talk participants an amazing view of both the signature white rump patch and pumpkin orange breast before flapping away into the fog.

However, howling winds and thickening fog forced us to retreat to the valley floor, where we were treated to the sight of an American Kestrel and a Great Horned Owl. Despite the inability to see any raptors on Hawk Hill, a mini Hawk Talk was enjoyed by a few brave, shivering participants at the base of the Hill. Come mid-afternoon, the winds at the top were still strong enough to blow away small children  and the visibility was down to ten feet, so the Saturday II team decided to call it a day and try again in a fortnight. We look forward to a clear and busy peak day in the near future!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

However, Hawkwatchers soon shed their many layers as the fog burned off. Raptor activity and weather up on the hill today were moderate; the wind kept the heat off of our diligent Hawkwatchers but didn't blow us off the hill, and the raptors kept us entertained but didn't overwhelm us. The highlights of the day included an early morning Merlin zooming through the fog, pausing only to catch an insect midair, as well as a few Northern Harriers giving us some prime examples of their unique silhouette and flight pattern. Overall, it was a pleasant day for the Friday II Hawkwatch, and we look forward to returning in two weeks for the migration peak!&lt;br/&gt;

Notable sightings included a female American Kestrel, a few Osprey, and a female Northern Harrier.

The heat seemed to discourage the raptors from flying in the early afternoon, as our sightings steadily declined before our team called it a day an hour early at 2:30. Early morning highlights included Osprey, some Cooper's Hawks, and a couple of Sharp-shinned Hawks. Visitors to Hawk Hill this week should be prepared for high temperatures with lots of ice water, hats, and a source of shade, and should consider an early morning trip instead of an afternoon one. &lt;br/&gt;

Even the Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks vacated the hill as temperatures climbed into the mid-nineties with no wind for relief. The "5th Quadrant" (the sky directly above the site) was especially busy today with many birds taking advantage of the thermals available. This gave Hawkwatchers good practice in distinguishing individuals in a kettle of different raptor species. Although warm weather is expected for the rest of the week, both Hawkwatchers and hawks are hoping for some cool winds in the coming days! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Hawkwatchers were cautious of overheating; lots of sunscreen and water were applied.  A squawk from the banders over the radio alerted those on the hill to the presence of a Broad-winged Hawk, the first of the season, flying high in the sky.   The call was seconded as High-Visibility Herb, recognized by his bright bike attire, summited the platform.  However, after the Broad-winged Hawk, raptor activity began to dwindle.  Turkey Vulture numbers continued to climb steadily throughout the day and there was a flurry of accipiter activity in the final hour.  &lt;br/&gt;

It was also the best day so far for total number of raptors counted, with a slightly higher total than yesterday's count. Highlights of the day included a beautiful overhead view of a Northern Harrier, an uptick in Cooper's Hawks, and a very cooperative Merlin who gave our newcomers a lingering look! In non-raptor news, three rare black swifts made a rare appearance above the south platform; we added three species each of butterflies and dragonflies to our bug sheet; and we were excited to witness a praying mantis pass us by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOLY HARRIER! Harriers are one of the few species we see on the Hill for which we distinguish adult males, adult females, and juveniles. Juveniles have a famously orange breast, typically described as "pumpkin" in tone. Females are comparatively streaky in the breast, which is unusual for an adult raptor (usually, juveniles are "streaky," while adults are "barred"). Males wear the nickname "The Grey Ghost" for their pale undersides, light grey wings, ghostly grey head, and supernatural yellow eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Over the course of the day, we saw nine different species and 356 individuals with 59.3 hawks per hour.  Even when the hawks were not present, it was lovely to be on the hill with mellow winds and clear skies all day. With sightings of juvenile and adult Peregrine Falcons, apprentices and interns had a great opportunity to compare the different plumages. Other highlights included a Northern Harrier in the last five seconds of Hawkwatch and an Osprey with very conspicuous molt. &lt;br/&gt;

The more unusual species were scattered throughout the day to keep us on our toes, starting with three morning Osprey who got the day off to a bright start. We caught great views of a Prairie Falcon, who obliged us by flying almost directly overhead before peeling away towards San Francisco. Two raptor identification study birds sent to us by Hawk Blind gave us a chance to sharpen our Accipiter identification skills, and a late-showing White-tailed Kite, called excitedly in by the west quadrant, left us feeling satisfied with our tenth species of the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARCHAIC ENGLISH FACT: We misspelled "bird" today and learned something new--according to the University of Michigan's Middle English dictionary, "brid" (also "brede," "berd," "burd," and "bord") is Middle English for the young of a bird.

Hawk Hill frequent fliers (Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures) were also present. Although today was relatively slow in terms of raptor activity, the hawk watchers had a reason to celebrate: Allen Fish, GGRO's beloved director, celebrated his 30th anniversary with the program today! Treats were provided and the volunteers got to hear Allen's favorite memories since he started working here in 1985. Congratulations, Allen!&lt;br/&gt;

The first few hours, Hawkwatchers felt stuck in the doldrums, and the interns in the west quadrant counted only three Turkey Vultures in a whole hour. The day became more exciting  when &#147;Ouch!&#148;, a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk recently outfitted with a GSM transmitter, appeared in the north quadrant and gave us a good look at her transmitter. San Franciscans, look out for Ouch! travelling over the city. A little while later, Hawkwatchers spotted an interesting Turkey Vulture that had white marks on its shoulders rather than a solid black back. Things started to heat up in the one o'clock hour, as new species besides our usual customers began to appear. The stars of the show were a beautiful juvenile Ferruginous Hawk and a Prairie Falcon that flew past us from Hill 88. These sightings were the first of the season for these two species! Other species of note were a White-tailed Kite, Red-shouldered Hawk, Northern Harrier, and multiple Sharp-shinned Hawks and American Kestrels. After spotting the leucistic Red-tailed Hawk last cycle, it seems like Monday I is continuing our streak of spotting awesome raptors!&lt;br/&gt;

The wonderful weather and views brought many visitors to the hill who were quite curious and enthused to learn what we were looking at and yelling about. Today, we spotted many of our signature Turkey Vultures and juvenile Red-tailed Hawks, with a noticeable abundance of adult Red-tailed Hawks. To spice things up in the late afternoon, a handful of Cooper's Hawks, Ospreys, and a singular adult Red-shouldered Hawk blew by the hill. Overall, it was a good first day for the Sunday 2 team, and we look forward to seeing many more species on the hill as the migration season continues!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HAWK FACT: Californian Red-shouldered Hawks were previously called Red-bellied Hawks due to their vibrant orange chest and belly. These hawks are most often found in oak woodlands and near rivers, but are also common in urban areas where eucalyptus groves are present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

We started off our counting at noon with a healthy dose of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures, followed quickly by a male American Kestrel that was an identification study bird from the banders at Hawk Blind. This early action was followed by some good Accipiter practice for the team as we had a good fly-by by a juvenile Cooper's Hawk. The weather stayed hot until the breeze picked up and began to blow the fog in as we left the hill, and we were treated to the sight of a wedding taking place over Kirby Cove! The Friday 2 team had a positive first day on the hill and we look forward to more birds next time around. &lt;br/&gt;

Actually, it was the exact opposite: the brightest, sunniest day we've had on Hawk Hill so far. The clear day allowed us to spot a bounty of raptors, and by the end of the day we totaled 9 different species.  Hawkwatchers were excited to spot the first Merlin of the year far off over the Golden Gate Bridge, identified in a spotting scope. It was a good day for watching Northern Harriers, as four individuals offered great views of their white rump patches and brilliant orange juvenile plumages. The day also stood out in the number of American Kestrels seen, often in male-female pairs. The quadrant system worked especially effectively today when a number of individual raptors flew around the entire hill and each quadrant passed the bird on to the next. Thursday II looks forward to continuing this great teamwork and counting many more raptors this season!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LITERARY FUN FACT: In T.H. White's novel The Once and Future King, the wizard Merlin turns a young King Arthur into a Merlin to learn lessons from the hawks in the castle's mews. A second fun fact: T.H. White himself experimented with falconry and wrote a book about his experience titled The Goshawk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Although only four species of raptors were seen, there were many highlights.  A few dark morph Red-tailed Hawks were seen; allowing our hawkwatchers to get some good long looks in as the circled the hill.  An adult Peregrine Falcon put on a show in front of the Golden Gate Bridge, stooping multiple times on a juvenile Red-Tailed Hawk.  And a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk required a double take as it had a few adult central tail feathers.  &lt;br/&gt;

The good weather brought some great sightings of seven different species of raptors. We completed three different ID studies and the last bird, a Red-tailed Hawk, gave us an excellent view. After its release, it decided to perch on the rock right in front of the north quadrant (we were even able to read part of its color band). The new apprentices were blessed with excellent sightings of two Osprey, a juvenile and an adult Peregrine Falcon, and a Red-shouldered Hawk. Towards the end of the day, the wind and fog began to roll in along with a pack of six Turkey Vultures, one of which was packing a rotten lunch. After holding on tight to this hunk of meat for several minutes, its prize was snatched away by a sneaky Raven. This dramatic exchange wrapped up a lovely day on the hill. &lt;br/&gt;

The great conditions brought in a bounty of raptor species. Along with the usual Red-tailed Hawks, Turkey Vultures, and Cooper's Hawks, we spotted Osprey, White-tailed Kites, Northern Harriers, American Kestrels, and a Red-shouldered Hawk for a grand total of eight species. This team also enthusiastically counted butterflies and dragonflies, and was able to identify 8 different species, including a few not included on our insect count form. On a team half-filled with first-year apprentice Hawkwatchers, returning members enjoyed training these newer volunteers. Monday II looks forward to an awesome season of Hawkwatching! &lt;br/&gt;

While stalling, we took a stroll up the Miwok Trail into Gerbode Valley in search of some birds. We spotted two Red-tailed Hawks, a Great Blue Heron, and a few passerines. At 1:00pm, we looked up to Hawk Hill for signs of clearing fog, but it remained immersed.  Sadly, no count was completed today.

After arriving to a hill full of fog, pockets slowly started to open up after 11:30am. Many juvenile Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures flew through the skies, allowing the new apprentices and interns to practice identifying some of our site&#146;s most common raptors. The monotony of continuous Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks was broken by sightings of two beautiful American Kestrels, male and female, and five accipiters which challenged the ID skills of all on the hill. Then off in the distant fog, a group of juvenile Red-tailed Hawks soared over the southern hillside, but one bird was not like the others. The pale, white color of the bird was initially explained by the poor visibility in the southern quadrant. However, as the bird traveled into the clearer east quadrant, volunteers realized it was a partially leucistic Red-tailed Hawk! This individual had a completely white upper side, while the underside displayed typical juvenile plumage. Hawkwatchers were flush with excitement upon viewing this rare individual in flight. Though much of the day was foggy and windy, this incredible bird was the perfect kick-off to Hawkwatch. Perhaps this bird was an auspicious sign of a unique 2015 season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTERDISCIPLINARY FUN FACT: In ancient Roman times, priests interpreted the flight of birds to determine the favor of the gods, a practice known as Augury. The eagle was a symbol of Zeus, king of the gods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
