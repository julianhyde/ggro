Whether or not this was to delay the onset of our end-of-the-season "review" is subject to question.  We hauled our luxurious food bounty up to the summit only to watch the rainclouds advancing from the south, eventually hitting us in the face.  However, we managed to squeeze in a few sightings before the onslaught of rain and snarfed as many snacks and cups of coffee as one can when trying to maintain the quadrant system.  Don't worry, best beloved, because we managed to have an entire feast upon returning to headquarters--enough food to cushion the blow of having to take a test (I'm sorry, a "review").   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So thank you Friday II for a lovely, albeit rainy, foggy season!  Raptor on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Instead, we ate delicious food and discussed world events, poetry, and small living things. All together, a fun day although relatively devoid of raptors (we did briefly see one or two foggy Red-tailed Hawks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for an amazing season, Thursday II! We interns have all noticed your dedication to learning and improvement over the season. You put the "ding" in birding and we will miss your amusing company.&lt;br/&gt;

Today the future came from the South and the future was rain.  We were (impressively) only sprinkled upon once after watching the giant plumes of rain skirt around us in all directions all day.  Hard to say whether the weather (intentional!) was keeping the birds down or if there were, in fact, no birds in the first place.  Our bridge Peregrine falcons conducted their 10:00 patrol of the area which has become kind of a standard.  Large kettles of Turkey vultures sprinkeled with a few Red-tailed hawks were abundant in the morning, but by late day we were hard pressed to see any raptors of any kind.  Luckily we were content to feast on an assortment of foods and casually spy on the ravens.  We left the hill under a full rainbow, which is a first for me and felt especially majestic and symbolic.  O, to be somewhere under the rainbow!  Why hasn't anyone written a song about that?  It feels like a missed opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;

We did manage to make it up to the annex and watch the only three birds in the air (two red-tailed hawks and a brave turkey vulture). As we watched these birds...we also managed to produce a nice spread of food on the bench, while the southeast winds became even more gusty. Eventually the winds brought the rain from Sutro towers...and here we are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck Monday II &lt;br/&gt;

Some of the highlights of the day were some showy aerial displays by the adult Peregrine pair, an Osprey that flew in front of the sun and the early-rising moon, and some interestingly-colored Red-tailed Hawks. We counted far more visitors (556) than raptors today, but still managed to spot hawks from between the massive throng of post-Thanksgiving visitors, and had many great opportunities to explain who we are and what we do. I felt a little better about the activity rate when I would tell kids what our numbers were for the day and watch their eyes widen in awe (&#147;you&#146;ve really seen over a hundred birds today?!&#148;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Friday I for your attention to detail, love of learning, and mutual support.

Perhaps not a raptor to eat.  However, there be not one, but TWO turkeys for our GGRO Thanksgiving feast.  The live bird tally for today far exceeded our turkey count&#151;by 111 times, in fact.  The day was warm and windless, with a thick haze falling over the bay and ocean.  We climbed the hill with three pies and fresh Dungeness crab in hand, and came down with our load considerably lightened.  Birds were mostly in distant kettles and were mostly Red-tailed Hawks.  A few accipiters and a Merlin zipped below us around the curve of the hill, but otherwise the majority of our birds were out over the Slacker hills, Mt. Tam, and Hill 88.  We were lucky enough to have a chocolatey-brown dark morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawk as one of our study birds, which immediately went and perched below the north platform.  In summary, today was a good day with good food and good people and birds were the whipped cream on top of the pie.  Thanksgiving metaphors, away!  Happy Turkey Day, raptor enthusiasts!&lt;br/&gt;

The day started off with a pair of adult Peregrines dive-bombing on a group of Pine Siskins. The majority of birds for the day still consisted of Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks, but we also saw a bunch of Northern Harriers and American Kestrels. The biggest highlight of the day was a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk that swooped in from Kirby Cove and made a tour of the hills. We had a wonderful time sharing snacks, enjoying the pizza that was our reward for spotting the Rough-legged Hawk last time we were out, and explaining migration patterns to all of the pre-Thanksgiving visitors on the hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for an exciting season full of beautiful days, high numbers, unusual birds, and lots of enthusiastic teaching and learning, Wednesday I!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Although the birds were few the fancy cheeses and baked goods brought by the hawkwatchers were many. Our highlights of the day were a male kestrel and a harrier, which might give you an idea of how slow it has been (but really it was SLOW). Hopefully Wednesday will pick up an exciting bird tomorrow...maybe of the feathered tarsi variety.  &lt;br/&gt;

We met for a morning meeting while another intern and I rambled about something or another ( just kidding it was a riveting talk on Rough-legged hawks).  However, early in the morning we realized that today was indeed very special. Today we saw not one, not two, but three Broad-winged hawks! We also had a few oddly late Osprey sightings as well, including a beautiful bird that flew right over us. So although we did not see the Rough-legged hawk that we all yearned for, today was indeed something to behold. &lt;br/&gt;

We lazed around, ate cookies, and had a leisurely powerpoint presentation.  Lo an behold when we opened the shades we were blinded by unexpected sunlight!  So we hurredly scrambled up to the hill to find the birds already circling.  A juvenile Northern Harrier and a handful of Red-tailed Hawks cruised around while we set up camp and began the count.  Early morning Peregrine Falcon fly-bys made things exciting.  There was much Red-tailed Hawk attacking to be had.  While things slowed considerably by the end of the day, we had our sixth species (Merlin!) zip by below the north platform thus enabling us to go out with a bang.  What a lovely day to come from such a tumultuous beginning!&lt;br/&gt;

Before we had even reached the summit of Hawk Hill, we found we had been beaten to it by a massive juvenile Ferruginous Hawk.  It made some lazy circles over the bay and hung around for a good 10 minutes while we all took our respective ganders.  We then settled into preparing for a jawdropping day spilling over with raptors.  This quieted gradually into a day of looking hopefully into an empty sky.  We were able to pick up a Red-shouldered Hawk, an adult Sharp-shinned Hawk and a few close Red-tails to curb the hunger, but these petered off and by 1:00 there were barely Turkey Vultures even on the ridges.  We are at least proud to say that we positively ID'd all of the raptors that we saw (i.e., no unidentified raptors).  The sky was overcast and everything had a wintery cast which made it beautiful albeit cold.  We looked over our shoulders as we left, wondering if we were going to miss that one Rough-legged Hawk that waited until 3:35 to fly over the hill, but saw nothing.  Now it's time to put our hands under hot water, make some cocoa, and prepare for the next wave of rain.  &lt;br/&gt;

Today was such a day.  It's was also Ken's birthday.  There were cupcakes.  There were also thousands upon thousands of American Robins (mixed with Varied Thrushes), all headed mysteriously northward.  Has anyone else noticed this?  Is it a sign of impending apocalypse?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wind out of the east and northeast was chilly and failed to bring us the birds for which we yearned.  So we bundled and un-bundled as the wind waxed and waned, and scanned the ridge lines feverishly.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Gull or raptor?  Wait...it's a gull.  Definitely gull."&lt;br/&gt;"Hold on, what's that falcon coming off Tam?"&lt;br/&gt;"It's a gull."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, it was one of those days. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Red-tailed hawks were the bulk of our sightings, supplemented by the occasional accipiter or Merlin.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the most exciting bird was a Short-eared Owl with its deep, loping wingbeats headed towards Golden Gate Park, and later another over North Slacker.  It would seem that Hawk Hill isn't just for the diurnal raptors anymore.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So everyone get ready for what might be the actual onset of fall and chilly weather.  Shove some gloves into your pack!  Bring your Big-Gulp-sized thermos!  If you have a body-suit windbreaker, this is the time to put it to use!  &lt;br/&gt;

We persisted despite not having our fearless leader, Mr. Power. Everyone pulled together to count the ever impressive number of redtails. Some highlights of the day included a great look at an adult Peregrine flying over us and a pretty personal look at a Ferruginous Hawk. We also got a great look at a late coming Swainson's Hawk. Overall it was a beautiful day with great diversity. Good luck Sunday I, don't forget your sunscreen and your sandals (with thick socks, just incase.)&lt;br/&gt;

Some of the highlights of the day: A juvenile Northern Harrier and a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk chasing each other back and forth across the sky, some eye-catchingly bright adult Red-Shouldered Hawks that soared over Kirby Cove, an adult Red-tailed Hawk that decided to still right off the platform of Hawk Hill for nearly an hour, and the resident pair of adult Peregrines calling to each other as they sped by overhead. Overall, a very solid day. Hopefully the numbers will stay up and some more species will join the party. The weather is slowly edging its way towards the chilly side, so bring layers.&lt;br/&gt;

But what better opportunity for a Thursday I bonding session than a rainy morning?  We took a field trip to the Marine Mammal Center for some non-raptor education and then went on Newtwatch 2014.  While we only technically had two newt sightings, our walk also included some wet Red-tailed hawks, Red-shouldered hawks, a juvenile Northern Harrier and a female American kestrel.  Additionally, there were some mysterious reptilian eggs (?), a den with honeycomb outside, and a 5-legged Jerusalem cricket.  Ah, the wonders of nature!  Now for some soup!  &lt;br/&gt;

Early on in the day we saw two adult Peregrines interacting with a raven, and we had a steady stream of male American Kestrels all day. However, the biggest jolt of excitement came when the Rough-legged Hawk finally arrived. It was a spectacularly dark bird, resembling more of a Turkey-Vulture with a Buteo head than a normal Rough-legged, but it flew around the entire hill and gave us all a look (albeit a slightly far and awkwardly-angled one). As if that were not enough, we also got to see a beautiful juvenile Ferruginous Hawk fly high overhead and show off its bright white underside. But wait, there&#146;s more! As the sunlight ebbed at the end of the day, we saw a very light bird with long, heavy wingbeats flying over the hills. A closer look revealed a flattened face and orange belly&#151; a Short-eared Owl! It flew around and fought with some ravens before drifting away towards Sausalito.&lt;br/&gt;

The highlights for the day included good views of both Bald and Golden Eagles, a high-flying White-tailed Kite, and a light-colored Peregrine Falcon. We also got to see two Humpbacked Whales far below us at the gate of Bay. We&#146;re enjoying the relatively high numbers this late in the season. The winds were out of the North-East, and it looks like we could be gearing up for another nice week. Make sure to bring lots of sunscreen, however, since it is still unseasonably warm.&lt;br/&gt;

We could see around 56% of our surroundings at any given time today.  Given this, our count turned out nicely!  We had a short parade of Red-tailed hawks slide over the hill early in the day in the precious bit of blue sky above us, but from then on out they tended to be distant, foggy, blobby buteos.  We had a Sharp-shinned hawk that turned into a Merlin half-way over the Golden Gate Bridge.  Great silhouette work, everyone!  A late day Peregrine put us in the 3-falcon range and was a lovely parting view from the hill.  I think we were all hoping for another 15 species, 500 bird day.  Alas, the winds were not in our favor (specifically in that there was no wind).  But oh, to be serenaded by fog horns!&lt;br/&gt;

It was a great foreshadowing for such an incredible day! We got a great number of Red-tailed Hawks and some great views of accipiters. Then, we also got to see some other, more unexpected, species. A Prairie Falcon gave us a great look as it flew up from Kurby Cove and a Broadwing graced us with his presence as he flew high in some thermals. Both are a little behind in the migration&#133; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some other highlights were a far out Ferruginous and a Golden Eagle that flew right over us, giving us a great view of its white base on the tail and white wing panels. But&#133; the highest of highlights for the day, was an adult Bald Eagle, which gave us the record number of 15 species for this migration season! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully this flurry of activity continues into the week. The infamous Rough-legged Hawk has yet to be seen. Good luck Wed II. Don&#146;t forget your sunscreen and your parkas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

He we were thinking it was a quiet, nippy November day when in fact the sky is ON FIRE WITH RAPTORS.  MORE RAPTORS THAN AT ONE COULD SHAKE A STICK!(?)  The day began slow and the pumpkin chips were consumed rapidly.  But then all around us, vast kettles of Red-tailed Hawks swept up from somewhere below the hill and had us craning our necks upwards!  Here a Merlin, there a Merlin and then suddenly a light falcon careening across south Slacker hill to perch, stoic, atop a rocky outcrop.  But was that our only Prairie falcon?  Nay.  Our second came lifting up from the rifle range and was silhouetted against the Point Bonita Lighthouse.  "Big falcon!  Really big falcon!  Someone please look at this giant falcon now, please!"  And sure enough, our second Prairie Falcon circled above us, peering down before a long flight to the city and beyond.  Similarly, our first Ferruginous Hawk rose nonchalantly amongst the sea of Red-tailed Hawks as if it were not some magnificent and gargantuan buteo.  Up and up and up until we had to look away due to its blinding whiteness.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Was it a good day?  No.  It was a great day.  &lt;br/&gt;If you're allergic to falcons, stay inside.  &lt;br/&gt;

We not only saw our 303rd broad-winged hawk as we arrived on the hill today, but we later saw our 304th and 305th within ten minutes of seeing a Swainson's hawk and prairie falcon (around 115Pm PST). That is right folks, we saw all four species of falcons that can be seen yearly in the Marin Headlands. Perhaps we will get very luckly this year and see their big cousin, the arctic gyrfalcon! Anyways, it was a very birdy day which may have been due to the nice mild weather. Mostly calm NW and W winds along with an average temp of 66 degrees allowed hawkwatchers to gaze into the headlands without feeling pressed to add or subtract any layers. However, we had little to no fog cover, so some birds were very high in the sky and many hawkwatchers had to continuously apply sunscreen (others simply looked like bandits as they covered up their face with UV reflecting fabric). We are still on high alert for the seasons 1st rough-legged hawk, so be on the look out as the Mon II team is bound to see it tomorrow. Oh! Also, we saw a lot of Red-shouldered hawk movement today...perhaps it will continue throughout this week :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOOD LUCK WEEK II!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Sun I &lt;br/&gt;

Wind out of the northwest sounded promising, but failed to produce the fruit of birds.  Some high altitude falcons and a single Golden Eagle kept us peering into the bright unknown, squinting and hopeful.  For so few total birds, we did see surprising diversity.

The highlight of the day was the wonderful (penultimate) hawk talk delivered by Bridget and Nick Villa, accompanied by a well-behaved juvenile female Cooper&#146;s Hawk. They covered a wide range of topics such as why we study raptors, why we study them in the Marin Headlands, and which one is the fastest. We even got to observe a Red-tailed Hawk as it stilled above the hillside and provided an excellent real life example. The last moment of excitement was a late Osprey before we left the hill to beat out the rain.&lt;br/&gt;

Hopefully the rain will stay away for Hawkwatch tomorrow, but if not, we need it anyways. It will be one of the win, win kind of days!&lt;br/&gt;

Since we can&#146;t prove that it doesn&#146;t, let&#146;s just say that we physically willed the fog to dissipate and were able to summit Hawk Hill.  Birds were popping over the hill early in the day, but dwindled by early afternoon.  We had a perfectly planar view of a Swainson&#146;s Hawk as it glided, un-flapping, from Hill 88 across the bay over to the Presidio.  The near-ish Golden Eagle was uplifting during the muggy heat of mid-day, and we had a few close encounters with adult accipiters.  We left the hill beneath a partial solar eclipse and chose to disregard any advice about not looking directly at the sun.  Update on intern cornea damage to come!  &lt;br/&gt;

We&#146;re starting to see a lot more adult accipiters lately &#151; a few flew right over Hawk Hill and gave us a great look at their orange-barred bellies.

A distant Ferruginous hawk and some late day Peregrine falcons rounded us up to a high species count for such a low count day.  As always, Saturday I went through an entire bag of ginger snaps and were persistently optomistic in the face of great heat.

We ascended the hill and were greeted by a jumble of buteos and a fantastically proximal juvenile Golden eagle.  If not facing south, one could not see the ominous wall of fog rolling in from the Pacific and by 12:30 most of our landmarks were flickering in and out of sight as we became eerily shrouded in patchy fog.  We held out for a smattering of low Turkey vultures and a nearby blue-backed adult male Cooper's hawk.  But the 25 mph fog-filled wind drove us down in elevation and we called it a day back in a nice, warm, walled space.  Keep your eyes on the weather!  Free advice from me to you:  wear pants always.&lt;br/&gt;

It started out with what looked like inpenetrable fog, but as we hung out on the hill in an act of seemingly foolish optimism, a gap appeared. Then, a few Turkey Vultures and a Red-shouldered hawk drifted through the gap, and the count was on. The fog immediately parted and revealed a sky full of Red-shouldered hawks to more than make up for the relative derth of accipiters. We caught a beautiful sighting of a juvenile Ferruginous hawk soaring close to the ground. Then, later in the day as the fog rolled back in low in the valley, the Blue Angel airplane show revved up as a few straggling birds decided to show them what you can do without a really loud engine.&lt;br/&gt;

It was fog, fog, more fog this morning, so we decided to meander around the lagoon.  Grebes galore!  But we got wind of clearing on top of Hawk Hill, so up we went!  Alas, the fog was more persistent than us and we admitted to defeat after our 29th bird in an hour or so.  Where is this fog coming from?  And when will it leave?  And more importantly, where will people go to look at planes if this fog continues?  &lt;br/&gt;

Everyone appreciated a long morning meeting, filled with literary discussion and flipping through Sibley's.  However, feeling obligated to go look at real, live birds, we went on a stroll to the lagoon and watched a Sora pick through the reeds and a few Eared grebes bob around a cluster of coots.  On the raptorial side, we were allowed spectacular views of an adult Peregrine falcon as it barraged a raven!  Also a juvenile Red-shouldered hawk, a pair of kestrels, a pair of Red-tailed hawks, and an adult Cooper's hawk.  It was still foggy up on the hill at 3PM, so don't feel bad about calling it at 1PM.  Hoping this blows out and we'll get a nice bird flow tomorrow!&lt;br/&gt;

We also had a kettle of about 20 turkey vultures who came over hawk hill to scrutinize our volunteer staff. Aside from the usual raptor suspects we had a Lewis and Acorn woodpecker.

However, it was but an illusion for upon reaching the summit of Hawk Hill one could see to Mt. Diablo and beyond!  As we stood overlooking a sea of fog with only the tops of the Golden Gate Bridge towers peeping out, what emerged from the mist but a monstorous and gleaming white buteo!  Lo and behold, a Ferruginous Hawk!  Buteos here, buteos there, buteos, buteos everywhere.  While the bird flow was a trickle at best, we were able to squeeze in 11 species with only 233 sightings.  The wind by the end of the day was as welcome as a familiar cat instead of a racoon in your kitchen when you get home.  So let's hope the heat gives us a break and the birds keep a-movin'!  &lt;br/&gt;

We toughed out the heat and were rewarded with two Ferruginous Hawks, a bunch of accipiters, a pod of dolphins, and migrating black swifts. If you are planning to come up to Hawk Hill this weekend, I strongly advise bringing plently of sunscreen, and about twice as much water as you think you might possibly need.&lt;br/&gt;

Today also seemed to have quite a few dark morph red-tails (those polymorphic birds keep things exciting!). All in all a great day despite the heat. Good luck to Friday 1 tomorrow!&lt;br/&gt;

We were surrounded by raptors flying everywhere. As the sun rose higher in the sky, our hopes for the day began to rise with it. We got great views of a Swainson's hawk flying overhead and a distant Prairie Falcon flying ever so close to the sun. Every quadrant was shouting with joy and yelling out species. Then, as the sun continued to climb, the wind slowly died, creating a very still afternoon. We were still continuously graced with accipiters and Red-tailed hawks. The day ended up being a record day for sightings and tying for species numbers. After such a glorious day, we were walking down the hill, and saw species number 15, a beautiful Ferruginous hawk. It was a great way to end the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck to the hawkwatchers tomorrow. Make sure to bring plenty of water and wear sunscreen.

In nearly every break of fog within the first three hours were many accipiters. We also saw this season's hight number of broad-winged hawks. Towards the end of the day, the fog broke up and finnaly showed us some decent mixed kettles of red-tailed hawks, broad-winged hawks, accipiters, and the occaisonal turkey vulture. While we were given a brief moment of great happiness by a deceptive turkey vulture, which we thought might have been a head-on golden eagle, we were treated to hawk nirvana at the end of the day in which we saw 80 sharp-shinned hawks and our seconed Swainson's hawk of the season. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peak is here!&lt;br/&gt;-Tue I&lt;br/&gt;

The ferruginous hawks are such large, light-colored buteos that when the first one started flying in, all we could see what a white V heading towards us.

Despite having seen only around 200 total raptors, we were treated to a speciose day.  A Ferruginous Hawk was gracious enough to entertain us and allow everyone a look through the scope.  Shortly thereafter a very golden adult Golden Eagle took a long and luxurious glide from Hill 88 to the immediate vacinity of Hawk Hill and passed on and away over the city.  We ended our day with a rainbow to the northeast.  What is on the other side of this rainbow?  Perhaps an unfathomable number of raptors pouring in for the weekend.

The rain let up and the fog cleared by 10:30.  The weather only got better from there, but raptors remained few and far between.  However, with rain comes ENORMOUS NUMBERS OF TERMITES and with enormous numbers of termites comes ENORMOUS NUMBERS OF WHITE-THROATED SWIFTS (and a few Vaux's Swifts!).  They zipped and turned and they were generally unpreturbed by our presence as they winged down the termites in front of our faces.  We were also treated to a perfet southbound 'V' of White-fronted Geese, making all kinds of ruckus up in the higher altitudes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In lieu of the recent termite explosion, here are some termite facts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Termites reproduce by swarming.  The swarms consist of workers that molt into reproductive, winged adults.  During this nuptial flight, most will become food for birds, frogs, lizards, and other animals.  Those that survive will become the kings and queens of future colonies.  Some scientists estimate that ants and termites combined make up more than 20% of the world's animal biomass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Wednesday II was feeling abandoned by both the raptors and our our leader as they both headed south for migration. Though we can't complain too much as we did have clear skies and good visibility till 3PM when the fog rolled in. Some of todays highlights were the inconsistant flow of sharp-shinned hawks and a very fiesty peregrine falcon, who took way too much pleasure in chasing away the less than graceful Cooper's hawks flying through it's airspace. Hopefully Thurs II will have better luck than we did, but where we managed to scoot by without getting rained on...I think you guys and gals may need your raincoats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy hawkwatching, &lt;br/&gt;     Wed II  &lt;br/&gt;

At 9:00 there were but four of us making our way up to Hawk Hill, but by 11:00 the number of counters had jumped to 18!  I'm sitting here and envisioning the utter chaos that today might have been had we not had so many eager raptor enthusiasts participate of their own volition!  The sky was brimming with accipiters, high and low, determined and lackadasical.  Right off the bat we had some Broad-winged Hawks soaring with Red-tailed and Cooper's Hawks in front of the Golden Gate Bridge.  The day only escalted from there, bringing us Merlins, Osprey, Red-shouldered Hawks, and a Golden Eagle!  Big birds, little birds, red birds, blue(ish) birds!  If you are not sure whether it's worth coming up to the hill in the next few days, picture this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You see a bird close by and raise your binoculars.  As you are focused on the near bird, you see another rising behind it.  And another and another until you are looking at a string of birds from the Golden Gate Bridge to Mount Tam.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to peak!&lt;br/&gt;

The fog lifted a bit today and we were able to get up on the hill with a decent ceiling of clouds above us. Once we got through our first hour of hawkwatch the flow of accipiters (short rounded wings and long tailed, hawks) really opened up. We had record numbers of sharp-shinned hawks (the smallest of the accipiters) for the 2014 season today, but unfortunately no adults showed up for the party. Among some of the neater birds seen today were the great looks we got at a soaring merlin and two dark-morph broad-winged hawks! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick quiz: How do you tell a juvenile dark morph broad-winged hawk from a juvenile dark morph red-tailed hawk?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyways, it was a fun time up on the hill and six hours of standing just flew right by.

The team decided to meander up the Miwok Trail, where we spotted two hovering female American Kestrels and a male and female Peregrine Falcon. As we wandered closer to Hawk Hill at the rifle range we spotted a beautiful male Kestrel and a Red-tailed hawk. The fog looked as if it were about to lift, so we decided to take our chances up on hawk hill. Alas, it was not meant to be. The fog was too thick and we decided to call it a day. Hopefully this fog will lift soon and we can get back to our quadrants, counting the majestic raptors in the Marin Headlands.&lt;br/&gt;

Instead, we took a nice walk around the lagoon and saw a pair of Peregrine Falcons, a few Red-tailed Hawks, a coyote hunting by the edge of the water, and a tree with five different warbler species all mixed together. From the edge of the Rodeo Valley Trail, we watched the fog rolling in even lower, and one of the Hawkwatchers concluded that Hawk Hill had turned into a Fog Volcano. After seeing that, we decided to call it a day.&lt;br/&gt;

We went up the hill and then down the hill and then back up the hill one last time to actually count the birds and we had a glorious few hours of only mild fog.  Despite the short count time, we got our binocs on a juvenile Northern Harrier cruising in the valley to the southeast of the hill.  There was also a period of time before the fog swallowed them that both of our bridge Peregrines were sitting atop the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge, reigning over their vast and beautiful kingdom as per usual.  &lt;br/&gt;

We had a juvenile Northern Harrier make a few passes along the lower West slope of the hill so that we got a great view of his pumpkin-colored breast. We also got some close views of Sharpies and Cooper's Hawks to help (or confuse) us on our accipiter identification skills. Some of the non-bird-related sightings of the day included the first unicycle to make it up to Hawk Hill, and the second marriage proposal our team has witnessed so far this season. Look out for more Broadwing Hawks, Red-shouldered Hawks, and Sharp-Shinned Hawks in the next few days (unless the predicted storm keeps us off the hill).&lt;br/&gt;

As the hours crept on, we got an incredible view of some juvenile Northern Harriers and the crescent-shaped wing windows of a Red-shouldered hawk. By far, the highlight of the day was the first sighting of the year, of a magnifiscent Ferrugious hawk. The three points of light, the white wing patches and white tail coverts, were shining brightly in the sun as the raptor slowly flew over us. Over all it was a fantastic day full of beautiful birds and wonderful people.&lt;br/&gt;

We also got a very early-season sighting: someone dressed as Santa Claus in the parking lot below.&lt;br/&gt;

While we did have a nearly constant W wind, our day was relatively slow. All of us were hoping to see Sat IIs prairie falcon, but we we not as fortunate. However, we did see quite a spectacle of adult red-tailed hawks defending their territory, from what I presume was a migratory adult red-tail, all of this just before we ended our count for today! It gave some of our newer hawkwatchers and visitors the opportunity to hear that iconic bald eagle scream from the commercials, that we all know is actually your local red-tailed hawk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck Tues II and remember to bring plenty of water and sunscreen! &lt;br/&gt;

We got a glimpse of some specks that ended up being our two large falcons--Prairie and Peregrine--and a slightly smaller speck that was our American kestrel for the day.  We looked at Red-tailed hawks from just about every angle and a juvenile Red-shouldered hawk treated us to a spectacular back-lit fly-over!  &lt;br/&gt;

No sight of our resident bridge Peregrines but had a few American Kestrels go whizzing by.  Still have our eyes on the horizon for the season's first Prarie.  We'll pass it to you, Monday II.

We practiced identifying different landmarks in the area and got very excited at every Turkey Vulture we saw. The one Red-tailed Hawk we saw spent a long time "stilling" over the slope of the hill, using an updraft to hold itself in the same position in the air while it scanned the area. Our dayleader Kim used this bird as an opportunity to explain his theory that juvenile and adult Red-tailed Hawks look different when they still because juvenile wings are thinner and have less fine control, so they end up moving their wings to stay in place, while the adults can control their position using only their wingtips. The highlight of the day for me was when I saw an American Kestrel suddenly pop up over the ridge and go zooming over the hill. Overall, not an incredibly exciting day, but definitely better than nothing.&lt;br/&gt;

While we didn't get up on the hill till 11 or so, our count exponentially increased as the day went on. Some of todays raptor highlights included this seasons first northern harriers (marsh hawks), Cooper's hawks, and a female kestrel. Hopefully the season continues on an upward curve and we break some records...though we still need our early season prairie falcon, so good luck tomorrow Friday I. &lt;br/&gt;-Thur I&lt;br/&gt;

We saw quite a few Turkey Vultures along with adult and juvenile Red-tailed Hawks, and an unidentificable accipiter. We had our first official migrant species with the sighting of a Sharp-shinned Hawk! Weird first time event on Hawk Hill, a two foot diameter drone was flown over Kirby Cove, several hundred feet East of Hawk Hill. &lt;br/&gt;

Unfortunately fogged out, but took a leisurely stroll around the lagoon.  Highlights included Belted kingfisher getting attacked by an angry Scrub jay, a RTHA, RSHA, Wilson's warblers, Western grebes, and a handful of Western bluebirds.
