A slightly overcast morning gave rise to some late sun, with moderate temperatures, and variable winds of moderate strength. The Red-tailed Hawks were out in full force today, with a whopping 140 sightings! We also saw many Northern Harriers, including two juveniles that seemed to be following each other and hunting. I arrived at the hill a little late and was greeted by an adult Peregrine Falcon flying low right over the hill. What a wonderful way to start the day! In the early afternoon a Ferruginous Hawk flew past the south platform, and we had a few moments of chaotic Sharp-shinned Hawk sightings. The real treat today was an unbelievable look at an adult Golden Eagle that flew from the Northwest, soaring low directly over the Hawkwatchers, before continuing South over the city. What a sight! Thanks for everything today Hawkwatchers!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luke Scott &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Mary Kenney and Andy Bradshaw &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Chris Tarr, Rich Eliason, Woody Woodbury, Paula Moser, Lisa Sargent, Wing Ng, Step Wilson, Ren Chen, Carmen DeLeon, Luke Scott &lt;br/&gt;

We started out captivated by an unordinary raptor visitor, a Short-eared Owl! Throughout the day we saw many of our ordinary birds as well—lots of Red-tailed Hawks. One of the Red-tailed Hawks was a dark morph juvenile that flew into every quadrant giving us stunning eye-level looks. We got some fun views of raptors on their journeys and raptors lingering too: mid-count, the team spotted a close Osprey that had a determined path juxtaposed to later observing a Northern Harrier hunting around. We were also entertained with less common overhead looks at a White-tailed Kite and a male American Kestrel. Some other exciting flying creatures were all the orange Vanessa genus butterflies fluttering about as we counted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Ren Chen &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Deborah Crooks &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Keith Gress, Linda Schneider, Mary Malec, Sam Wong, Step Wilson, John Davis, Denise Peck, Anne Ross, Rose Fielding, Ren Chen &lt;br/&gt;

Most of the birds we saw were remarkably high up and/or at a distance. Most notably, the juvenile Golden Eagle that almost blended in with a group of five Turkey Vultures. We are all inspecting the Turkey Vultures after yesterday’s surprise! After some time straining our eyes to find birds far away, we got great looks at a male Northern Harrier and a light-colored Merlin. A dark morph juvenile Red-tailed Hawk also flew by the North quadrant showing off its chocolatey plumage! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Ren Chen &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Ken Wilson &amp; Becky Olsen &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Ann Meisinger, Carol Weinstein, Cody Levin, Laura Thomas, Maggie Montenegro, Holly Thomas, Brian O'Laughlin, Sam Hontalas, Rose Fielding, Ren Chen &lt;br/&gt;

The dewy morning also included appearances of two gray ghosts (adult male Northern Harriers) gliding through the headlands! The biggest highlight of the day was when Hawkwatchers stumbled on a dark vulture-like silhouetted bird. What could this possibly be? Our bird teetered along the wind, until someone yelled out... DARK MORPH FERRUGINOUS HAWK. Such a delightful way to wrap up the day, huge thanks to the birds and crew! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Doris Rodriguez &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Jane Rudebusch &amp; Jan Ambrosini &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Tim Stroshane, Krish Maypole, Holly Thomas, Doris Rodriguez &lt;br/&gt;

A small opening over the bay allowed us to spot Red-tailed Hawks rising over the trees before our view vanished again. There were whispers of a southwest wind with temperatures in the mid 50’s-low 60’s F. After spending time chatting about raptor migration and conservation with our visitors from the VA, we huddled by our box of pastries for a picnic lunch then dispersed with a total of 1 hour and 4 redtails counted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Carmen DeLeon &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Holly Thomas &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Will Ludan, Nick Yatso, Denise Peck, Dan Knight, Doris Rodriguez, Luke Scott &lt;br/&gt;

The birds kept us busy today, and we had sightings of 10 different raptor species. The highlight of the day was a juvenile Ferruginous Hawk that was spotted in the distance, and slowly started filling our scopes more and more as it got closer. It finally flew directly over the hill as it continued its journey south, and we all got a great view of the crisp white feathers and signature Ferruginous “smile”! We also had male American Kestrels consistently circling the hill throughout the day, which is always a treat. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Rose Fielding &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Catherine Elliot and Gretchen Zantzinger &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Tom Luster, John Davis, Pauline Yeckley, Ren Chen, Luke Scott, Denise Peck &lt;br/&gt;

It was a cold and slow start to the day with persistent haze surrounding us as raptor sightings drifted in and out of the blur. Light west winds were up to 3 mph with temperatures in the low 60’s F. Northern Harriers led the morning, drifting by through the valley. We were excited to see an adult male Northern Harrier, with its cloudy grey plumage perfectly matching the surroundings. A Merlin swooped around the count area rising high above the bay and a flow of Red-tailed Hawks rounded out our midday. Later in the afternoon, the sky somewhat cleared with more sun beaming through the clouds. With more... Harriers popping in from the rolling hills! It was worth withstanding brisky winds and hazy clouds.

However, we had a great walk around the lagoon instead and even managed to see a Turkey Vulture and a Red-tailed Hawk fly by – so it wasn’t a totally raptor-less day! We were also reminded to look down occasionally when we saw a beautiful banana slug meandering across the path. Sometimes it’s nice to have a bit of a reminder to enjoy all the beauty around us, not just the things that are high in the sky! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Rose Fielding &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Sam Hontalas &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Melissa Kohner, Alex Cox, Parker Holzman Smith &lt;br/&gt;

The sky was slightly overcast, creeping towards nearly total cloud coverage by 3pm, with some light variable winds that raptors seemed to opportunistically ride. The Falcons were out today: we had five Peregrine Falcon sightings, three Merlins, and two American Kestrels. We also saw a single beautiful adult Broad-winged Hawk. My personal highlight was seeing the two Ospreys soaring over Hill 88. One of them disappeared, but the other slowly made its way over to the hill giving the Hawkwatchers a nice look.

It was also a good day for male American Kestrels, with lots of hunting activity observed. The afternoon lull was substantial, but then a west wind picked up and with it came an Osprey, a Merlin, and some great looks at adult Sharp-shinned and Cooper’s Hawks.

There was light cloud cover and haze with short wisps of 3 MPH west wind and temperatures in the low 70’s. There was not a Peregrine Falcon to be found, but a big afternoon surprise instead! Hawkwatchers spotted a lanky looking bird eating an insect on the wing. It flew around the count area, glowing against the south quadrant sun. As the team felt puzzled by the slow flapping and slender, yet raggedy wing shape, they repeatedly remarked, “What a weird bird! It can’t possibly be a falcon, but what else could it be?” Ever thankful for digital photos, the team “time travelled” to contemplate their identification and concluded that it was a Mississippi Kite! Mississippi Kites are typically found in the outer south-central U.S. and continue down eastern Mexico and into South America. This is an extremely rare sighting for Hawk Hill and a delight for the whole team to experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carmen DeLeon &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Courtney Buechert &amp; Jon Altemus &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Jan Ambrosini, Wing Ng, Kimberlie Moutoux, Kendra Armer, Brian O’Laughlin, Don Bartling, Holly Thomas, Heller Stanton, Rose Fielding &lt;br/&gt;

The weather stayed in the 50s and 60s today which is a welcoming shift from the hot days we’ve been having on the hill. Today was filled with high numbers of accipiters and more sightings of adult raptors than the beginning of the season. We saw plenty of interspecies interactions, many being between ravens and buteos-- Red-tailed Hawks and a Red-shouldered Hawk. We even witnessed some nice close-up intraspecies interactions between Sharp-shinned Hawks and Red-tailed Hawks doing flips in the air! Some cool solo bird sightings include nice views of a Merlin, and later a Peregrine Falcon. There was even a juvenile Cooper’s Hawk that perched along the railing by the wingspan diagram, giving us a great look at its features. I can go on about all the fascinating sightings today, but I’ll end with this: the birds are migrating and along the way they’re giving us some wonderfully exciting glances that I’ll never get tired of. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Ren Chen &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Mary Kenney &amp; Andy Bradshaw &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Chris Tarr, Woody Woodbury, Paula Moser, John Davis, Rose Fielding, Luke Scott, Ren Chen &lt;br/&gt;

Unfortunately, we were not able to get an official count in due to the fog shrouding Hawk Hill throughout the morning and afternoon. However, we still had some avian entertainment watching a newly hatched baby quail scratching around on the ground during our morning meeting! We decided to change things up a bit and do some raptor ID quizzes back at the GGRO office, which was a fun way to practice and talk through tricky identification issues. We even saw a lone juvenile Red-tailed Hawk and a Turkey Vulture fly over the office building, so at least it wasn’t a totally raptor-less day! The fog provided a welcome break from the heat wave that hit the hill during yesterday’s count, which is one silver lining. Hopefully it clears out by tomorrow! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rose Fielding &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Don Bartling, Michaela Figari &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Courtney Buechert, Patti Lessard, Wing Ng, Heller Stanton, Luke Scott &lt;br/&gt;

In the early afternoon, the wind fell off, increasing temps to a high of 87-deg. The 2-3 pm hour brought some much-appreciated cooling west winds to finish the day. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We had a good range of species today with close looks at Red-shouldered and Cooper’s Hawks. There seemed to be an American Kestel scooting by every ½ hour or so, although many of them stalled long enough to catch a few dragonflies en route.  The Red-tailed Hawks mostly worked the Slacker ridgeline above Sausalito all day.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were a good number of dragonflies aloft today – it was difficult to put your binoculars in the sky anywhere and not have 2+ dragonflies in your field.  Most common were Common Green Darners, Variegated Meadowhawks, Black Saddlebags, Flame Skimmers, and Blue Mosaic spp. Also lots of insectivore birds, especially swifts and swallows, as well as Blue-Gray Gnatcatchers all over Hawk Hill. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Allen Fish &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Mary Kenney &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count team: Nat Smale, Dan Foldes, Maureen Grabowski, Woody Woodbury, Dennis Davison, Holly Thomas, Allen Fish &lt;br/&gt;

We ended up counting 182 raptors; the steady increase in raptors counted per day is giving us a good reminder that peak season is just around the corner. There was a healthy diversity of 8 species counted, including another Merlin and the second Sharp-shinned Hawk of the season! We were treated to some incredible aerial acrobatics when a male American Kestrel and a juvenile Sharp-shinned Hawk got into a bit of a tussle right at eye level with the counting team. Both birds flew off with their feathers and egos intact, and we all marveled at the show.

With visibility obscured on the hill in the morning, we meandered down to the lagoon to see if the birds there would be cooperative. We were treated to views of all our local favorites – herons, egrets, cormorants, kingfishers, pelicans, mallards, warblers, hummingbirds, bushtits, and more! Even the raptors gave us a few consolation glimpses – we saw a Red-tailed Hawk and several Turkey Vultures as we passed the time eating lunch at the lagoon. We returned to the hill at 1:00 for one last look; our hopes were momentarily raised when we saw a patch of sunny sky to the northeast, but they were quickly dashed when the fog blew in again on a cold breeze. Oh well – better luck to tomorrow’s crew! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Rose Fielding &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Christine Carino &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Bob Blumberg, Susan Greef, Arden Bucklin-Sporer, Patricia Contaxis, Lydia Bruno, Ashley Friscia, Rose Fielding &lt;br/&gt;

The count team retreated to Rodeo Lagoon for a little training on Red-tailed Hawk plumages and ageing, and we discovered that the two grandmother eucalyptuses in front of the Ft Barry Chapel are a superb songbird magnet. In 30 minutes we observed: Western Tanagers, Swainson’s Thrush, Olive-sided Flycatcher, Pine Siskin, Lesser Goldfinch, Wilson’s Warbler, Pygmy Nuthatch, Allen's and Anna's Hummingbird, Western Flycatcher, Nuttall's Woodpecker, and Townsend’s Warblers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rodeo Lagoon also produced some great bird looks: a royal flush of herons and egrets; 45 Brown Pelicans; a Belted King (Queen) fisher, and a single butt-bobbing Wilson’s Snipe.  Where are the Red-necked Phalaropes? A few Turkey Vultures gave us passing looks this morning, as did one Redtail. But all in all, not a day for watching the raptors flow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Allen Fish &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Courtney Buechert, Jon Altemus &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Jam Ambrosini, Wing Ng, Ren Chen, Allen Fish, Kimberly Moutoux, Kendra Armer, Brian O’Laughlin &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

The windless and hot morning might have been tiresome if it wasn’t for the Prairie Falcon spotted perched on a rock on the South side of the hill! Almost as soon as the words “Prairie Falcon” were uttered the bird took flight, disappearing to the southwest for a few moments, before circling back and jetting past the hill towards San Francisco. This was the first Prairie Falcon seen from Hawk Hill this season: not a bad start to the day! The exciting start to the day was followed by a sporadic flurry of American Kestrels darting past the hill. Later in the day a west wind picked up a bit, allowing us some reprieve from the heat as a gradual stream of Red-tailed Hawks and Turkey Vultures floated around. We also spotted the resident Peregrine Falcon sitting on the north tower of the bridge and were pleased to see a few Cooper’s Hawks and Northern Harriers fly by the hill.

Without much of a breeze to encourage them, the raptors stayed hidden for most of the morning with only the occasional Turkey Vulture or Red-tailed Hawk making an appearance. However, by midafternoon we started getting quite a show! The team ended up with 10 American Kestrel sightings, which is a record for the 2024 season so far. One female kestrel even treated us to a close, eye-level fly by that had us all exclaiming with joy; whether it’s the first time or the 1000th time you’ve seen a kestrel up close, it just never gets old!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the kestrels, we had another momentous sighting – the first Swainson’s Hawk of the season! These unique buteos aren’t seen from Hawk Hill very often, so getting a visual of one is always special. This juvenile spent some time circling with a few Red-tailed Hawks before taking off and continuing its journey.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking forward to seeing what excitement the migration brings us tomorrow!

It was consistently hot and clear outside all day. There was minimal wind with it picking up just a tad towards the last hour. Our count started at 11am today, after our introductions and raptor identification refreshers. The raptor pop quiz was a helpful reminder, especially when we got a wonderful look at a mysterious accipiter in the first hour. We identified it as a Cooper’s Hawk after seeing a rounded tail and stiff wing beats, among other fieldmarks. Throughout the day, we got a plethora of other raptors, and non-raptor birds flying both near and far. Notably, the pair of American Kestrels (male &amp; female) that we saw during the second half of our count. It was truly a joy to experience the kestrels dancing in the sky and showing off in every quadrant! In another perspective, the Red-tailed Hawks in the area appeared to not be fond of this and dove at the kestrels several times, successfully driving them away from the area. With the rain yesterday, and the nice weather today, we ended up seeing 7 raptor species (and 6 other bird species), including our first Sharp-shinned Hawk of the season. The raptor sightings were fairly stable, with a rate of 39 raptors an hour today.

Before too long the rain stopped and some clear sky opened, but a thick layer of fog remained looming over the hill preventing us from counting raptors. The team headed down to Rodeo Lagoon where we talked about the influence of topography and wind direction on raptor movements in the Marin Headlands. We even spotted a Belted Kingfisher (though I was pretty sure it was a Ringed...shoutout to John Davis for reminding me that I don’t live in Texas anymore!). The weather below Hawk Hill teased us with blue skies and warm air, but the top of the hill remained shrouded in fog, dashing our hopes for hawk spotting.

We finally found the fog bank cloaking the Farallones, 26 miles away, but it stayed offshore which was just fine with us.  Morning still winds and warm air (75-deg) turned to a stiff west wind in the afternoon.  The hawks were mostly working the ridges, and mostly juvenile Red-tailed Hawks, with a few Cooper’s Hawks and Northern Harriers thrown in. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The “best” bird of the day was a juvenile Bald Eagle spotted just west of Hawk Hill by Hawkwatch Manager Rose Fielding as she was driving, and so didn’t make it on to the official count.  But it’s great to know these young eagles are moving around. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another non-Hawk Hill raptor note: Thanks to Deborah Crooks and Ben Dudek for alerting us to the California Condor sighting/photo by George Chrisman on Mines Road east of Livermore yesterday – a mere 60 miles straight-line distance from the Golden Gate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Allen Fish &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleader: Horacio Mena &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Woody Woodbury, Dennis Davison, Dan Foldes, Nate Smale, Holly Thomas, Wing Ng, Lisa Sargent, Ren Chen, Sam Hontalas &lt;br/&gt;

Despite starting off with strong sun that had us quickly shedding layers, by midafternoon the chilly fog had rolled in and we found ourselves bundling up again. Luckily it didn’t last long, and the sun reappeared long enough to warm us up and usher in some new raptors with a nice breeze. A highlight of the day was spotting 7 American Kestrels, which was quite a treat! Other notable birds were a gorgeous, chocolatey juvenile dark morph Red-tailed Hawk flying overhead, and a Peregrine Falcon perched on the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Big westerlies blew through the day spiking at 18 mph but mostly in the 6-10 mph range.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the raptor activity was a steady dance of juvenile Red-tailed Hawks stringing along the Slacker Ridge above Hwy 101, and a few close Cooper’s Hawk flybys, and a wonderful braiding flight by three female American Kestrels.  Late in the day a juvenile Bald Eagle (brown belly, white wingpits, big dark head) made a slow and direct flight north to south across the west side of Hawk Hill, barely noticing the slamming west winds.  The eagle tracked right across the Golden Gate heading toward Baker Beach, San Francisco.

With our fingers crossed, we stared at the white fogged background hoping for breakage, but it didn’t let up today and the team ended up leaving Hawk Hill at 1pm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Ren Chen &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Jon Altemus &amp; Courtney Buechert &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Jan Ambrosini, Kimberlie Moutoux, Wing Ng, Kendra Armer, Holly Thomas, Allen Fish, Ren Chen &lt;br/&gt;

The day started off cold and thick with fog, and it didn’t show any signs of relenting as we spent the morning doing introductions and getting back into the migration season mindset. At 12:45, we were about ready to call it a day and have our dreams of Hawkwatching dashed – but luckily, the rest of the team was more optimistic than the staff members, and we decided to head up the hill for one last look just in case. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It’s a good thing we did – the fog lifted enough to give us one amazing, sunny hour of counting! We saw 23 Red-tailed Hawks, 5 Turkey Vultures, 2 beautiful juvenile Northern Harriers, and one lone Cooper’s Hawk for some accipiter representation. Not bad for one hour of data collection! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What a lovely start to the season – can't wait to do it all again tomorrow! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;–Rose Fielding &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dayleaders: Deborah Crooks, Conner Cimmiyotti &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Team: Linda Schneider, Keith Gress, Sam Wong, Mary Malec, Wing Ng, Maureen Grabowski, Rose Fielding, Allen Fish &lt;br/&gt;
