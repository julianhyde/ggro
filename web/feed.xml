Here are a few more in case you need more cringe-worthy jokes&#133;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do you organize a solar eclipse party?&lt;br/&gt; ...You planet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why didn't the sun go to college?&lt;br/&gt; ...It already had like a million degrees!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, happy eclipse day everyone! We hope you stayed safe and protected your peepers! Monday II Team went out to the annex (due to fog) decked out in some sweet eclipse shades. Our eye gear became more of a fashion statement as the fog eclipsed the eclipse. We did a loop around the lagoon and watched some Great Blue Herons and Snowy Egrets. The interns also stared at a Pied-billed Grebe for an excessive amount of time before having to catch up with the rest of the team. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alright, one more joke!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What did the sun say when it reappeared after an eclipse?&lt;br/&gt; ...Pleased to heat you again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully the weather heats up and the fog clears out tomorrow for our Tuesday II Hawkwatchers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

We made our way to the Hill and stopped briefly at the annex to arrange carpools when we saw two adult Peregrines gliding overhead. Too bad we didn't see them when our count started but it was a great sight nonetheless!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When we made it up to the Hill we were greeted by a layer of fog. But after an hour the skies cleared up pretty nicely and Redtails and Turkey Vultures started flying past. There were plenty of visitors up on the Hill today and were able to see juvenile Redtails hovering right in front of the west and north quadrants. The season's first Red-shouldered Hawk, its wing crescents illuminated by the fog, was seen flying over Angel Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to the Sunday 1 team for another good day on the Hill and we're excited for many more to come,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lara and Danielle &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

However, the day did not end without some excitement first. We walked around the lagoon, where we saw a small orange orb that turned out to be a female Kestrel perched on a tree - hanging out next to a woodpecker. We then followed the Miwok Trail for a while and worked on our Turkey Vulture identification skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later on we made our way to the rifle range, where we shared our best raptor jokes (if you have any good ones, please, please share). As we were munching on our lunches, we spotted a couple of Redtails, one perched on a cypress and another making its way across the valley. The highlight of the day was a visit from a juvenile Cooper's Hawk that stuck around long enough for all of us to get a good look. After watching a coyote eat some moles and many Bluebirds scavenge for insects, we decided to make our way up to Hawk Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oddly enough, up at the Hill there were not too many birds or people thanks to the fog, so were not able to count anything for the day. However, the team's morale is still high and we can't wait for the coming weeks. 'Til next time, raptor aficionados!&lt;br/&gt;

Although the fog was low and persistent, it couldn't keep us away from the Hill! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After getting a good look at some perched Cooper's Hawks and Redtails from the Annex, we headed up to Hawk Hill with high hopes of spotting more. However, after a couple of hours we had only caught a glimpse of some Redtails and Turkey Vultures swirling in the fog. Much fun was had getting to know the team, and we can only hope for better luck in the next coming days!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy birding!&lt;br/&gt;

Based on yesterday's numbers, the Thursday I team was eager to dust off their binoculars and hit the hill. The day started off quickly with two female American Kestrels zooming by the south quadrant and Redtails stilling all around us. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A highlight of the day was a yell from Step to &#147;come check out this bird!&#148; In our sights was the first Peregrine Falcon of the season! The juvenile falcon was being harassed (or was it doing the harassing?) by two Redtails while we watched with glee. Bob Power managed to excite the interns with a shout of &#147;whirly bird,&#148; but to everyone else this just meant a helicopter. Good one, Bob!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, Thursday I started the season with a strong first day and with two wonderful new dayleaders, Natasha and Laura. Thanks to our fellow hawkwatchers for a wonderful day. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep up the good work,&lt;br/&gt;Ashley and Lara&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Hawk Hill was ominously shrouded in fog, so the team moved to the annex. Two adult Red-tailed Hawks were immediately scoped out perched directly in front of the lookout. Some suspected that the two might be a local mated pair. The fog persisted and both the Redtails and the Hawkwatchers left the hill. Stay tuned, Folks!&lt;br/&gt;

We watched a short memorial video of Lewis's life and shared stories from over the years. Thank you to Jim H. and Tim B. for coming to remember this great hawkwatcher and celebrate his contribution to the GGRO and beyond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, we didn't make it to the Hill today due to pesky fog but we braved Conzelman Rd. and fought for a parking spot at the annex. From this view point, we spotted a few redtails and turkey vultures. We hope the sun will shine on the Hill by next Monday 1, but for our fellow hawkwatchers later this week, we hope sooner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We would like to end this blog post and start the season with a Lewis Cooper original haiku titled "Red-tailed Hawk." To see Lewis orate his haikus on video, please visit this link: <a href="https://vimeo.com/37234971">https://vimeo.com/37234971</a>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the gate, soft blown fog cloaks the Bay.&lt;br/&gt;Against the wind she hangs.&lt;br/&gt;Waiting.&lt;br/&gt;
